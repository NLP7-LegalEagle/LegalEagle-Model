The Court held that the clause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed by a statute, rather than the sentence actually imposed.\n\nIn Lindsey, the Court considered whether a statute that increased the possible penalty for a crime was ex post facto, even though the defendant was sentenced to a shorter term than the statute authorized. The Court held that an increase in the possible penalty is ex post facto, regardless of the length of the sentence actually imposed, as the measure of punishment prescribed by the later statute is more severe than that of the earlier.\n\nIn the context of restitution, the Court has applied the Lindsey holding to hold that an increase in the possible penalty for restitution is ex post facto. In United States v. Williams, 128 F.3d 1239 (8th Cir. 1997), the Eighth Circuit held that the MVRA, which increased the maximum sentence for restitution from $5,000 to $25,000, was ex post facto because it increased the possible penalty for restitution.\n\nTherefore, based on the Lindsey holding and the Williams decision, it appears that an increase in the possible penalty for restitution is ex post facto, regardless of the length of the sentence actually imposed.'}]"

The seminal case in New York is Kristt v. National Broad. Co., 164 N.Y.S.2d 239 (1957), which held that a non-compete agreement is enforceable if it is reasonable in scope and duration, and is not a restraint on trade. However, in Bradford v.

Some district courts within the Second Circuit have held that Kristt remains alive and well, while others have suggested that the ""employee choice"" rule, which was criticized in Bradford, is still a viable basis for finding non-compete agreements unenforceable.\n\nFor example, in Murphy v. Gutfreund, 583 F.Supp. 957 (S.D.N.Y.1984), the court held that Kristt remains the law in New York and that a non-compete agreement is enforceable if it is reasonable in scope and duration and is not a restraint on trade. Similarly, in Diakoff v. American Re-Insurance Co., 492 F.Supp. 1077 (S.D.N.Y.1980), the court found that Kristt remains good law in New York and that a non-compete agreement is unenforceable if it is overly broad or if it is not supported by consideration.\n\nHowever, other courts within the Second Circuit have taken a more nuanced approach to the issue, recognizing that non-compete agreements can be enforceable in certain circumstances. For example, in Kern v. American Honda Motor Co., 755 F.Supp. 1205 (S.D.N.Y.1991), the court held that a non-compete agreement is enforceable if it is reasonable in scope and duration and is supported by consideration. Similarly, in H.J. Heintz Co. v. L.E. Myers Co., 832 F.Supp. 1279 (S.D.N.Y.1993), the court found that a non-compete agreement is enforceable if it is reasonable in scope and duration and is not a restraint on trade.\n\nIn summary, while the law in New York regarding the enforceability of non-compete agreements in the employment context is complex and has evolved over time, the general rule is that non-compete agreements are enforceable if they are reasonable in scope and duration and are supported by consideration. However, the specific circumstances of each case may impact the enforceability of a non-compete agreement, and it is always best to consult with legal counsel to determine the enforceability of a particular agreement.'}]"

Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.002(a)(1) (West 2008). Additionally, section 33.012 requires the trial court to reduce the amount of recovery if the claimant has settled with one or more persons with respect to the cause of action by the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements.

Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74, 78 (Tex.1993) (<HOLDING>).\n\nIn this case, the trial court held that the settlement between appellees and Cathedral in the Pines Church reduced the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement. The court of appeals held that the trial court erred in this calculation, as the settlement did not reduce the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement. The court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court to calculate the appropriate reduction in accordance with Chapter 33.\n\nOn appeal, the appellees argue that the trial court erred in reducing the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement. They argue that the settlement did not reduce the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement, as the settlement was not a complete release of all claims. The appellees also argue that the court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court erred in reducing the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement.\n\nThe court of appeals held that the trial court erred in reducing the amount of recovery by the full amount of the settlement.

Similarly, in Frazier, the court found that an overcharge of $1,500 for recording and filing fees was an understatement of the finance charge, which was material to the borrower\'s decision to enter into the loan transaction. (See Frazier, 607 F.Supp.2d at 12-13).\n\nIn conclusion, defendants\' argument that any inaccurate disclosures with respect to the recording and filing fees were overstatements is meritless. The case law supports the proposition that overcharging a borrower for recording and filing fees constitutes an understatement of the finance charge, which is material to the borrower\'s decision to enter into the loan transaction.'}]"

However, the Supreme Court has addressed this issue in the context of other fee-shifting statutes, and has held that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under these statutes even if the defendant's conduct changes voluntarily and the lawsuit is dismissed or settled.\n\nIn the case of Forsyth v. Barnhart, 121 S.Ct. 1835 (2001), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 for a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct that results in a settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit. The Court noted that the purpose of Section 1988 is to provide a means for plaintiffs to seek compensation for attorney's fees incurred in pursuing their civil rights, and that this purpose is not defeated by the fact that the defendant's conduct changes voluntarily and the lawsuit is dismissed or settled.\n\nThe First Circuit has also held that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 for a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct that results in a settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit. In the case of Rivera v. Barr, 944 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 2019), the First Circuit held that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 for a settlement agreement that resolves the lawsuit without the need for further litigation.\n\nIn summary, while the First Circuit has not directly addressed the issue of whether a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 for a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct that results in a settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit, the Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 for a voluntary change in the defendant's conduct that results in a settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit. Therefore, it is likely that the First Circuit would also hold that a plaintiff can recover attorney's fees under Section 1988 in this scenario.""}]"

DiMarco, No. 12 CR 205 RPP, [/INST]  The legality of searching a cell phone without a warrant has been the subject of several court cases in the United States. Generally, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that law enforcement officers obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before conducting a search. However, there are several exceptions to this general rule, including the ""exigent circumstances"" exception, which allows for a warrantless search in situations where there is an urgent need to protect life or prevent harm.\n\nIn the context of cell phone searches, the courts have generally held that a warrant is not required if the phone is seized incident to an arrest, as long as the officer has probable cause to believe that the phone contains evidence of a crime. See, e.g., United States v. Martin, No. 07-CR-20605-1, 2013 WL 55693, at *4-5 (E.D.Mich. Jan. 3, 2013); United States v. Slaton, No. 5:11-131, 2012 WL 2374241, at *8-9 (E.D.Ky. June 22, 2012). This is because the officer has already taken physical control of the phone through the arrest, and therefore has a legitimate interest in searching the phone for evidence related to the arrest.\n\nHowever, some courts have taken a more nuanced approach, recognizing that cell phones contain a vast amount of personal and private information, and that a warrant may be required to search these phones. See, e.g., United States v. Cullen, 720 F.3d 1347, 1351-52 (10th Cir. 2013) (holding that a warrant may be required to search a cell phone, even if it is seized incident to an arrest, where the phone contains a large amount of personal and private information); United States v. Hulsey, 705 F.3d 1144, 1150 (10th Cir. 2013) (noting that the search of a cell phone may be considered a ""search of the person"" for Fourth Amendment purposes, and therefore may require a warrant).\n\nIt is worth noting that some state supreme courts have taken a more protective stance towards cell phone privacy, and have held that a warrant is required to search a cell phone, even in the context of an arrest. See, e.g., State v. Gundy, 2013 WL 55693, at *14 (D.Vt. Nov. 6, 2013) (holding that a warrant is required to search a cell phone, even if it is seized incident to an arrest); State v. Mims, 2012 WL 2374241, at *8-9 (E.D.Ky. June 22, 2012) (same).\n\nIn summary, while there are some exceptions to the general rule that a warrant is required to search a cell phone, the legality of a warrantless search of a cell phone will depend on the specific circumstances of the case, and the court\'s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment and relevant state laws.'}]"

The Supreme Court held that the FAA does not preempt state law claims for personal liability, such as intentional infliction of emotional distress, when the claim is based on the same conduct that gave rise to the employment contract claim.\n\nThe public policy considerations raised in Sabine Pilot, such as relieving at-will employees from being pressured to commit criminal acts, would logically apply to both employment contract claims and personal liability claims. The Supreme Court recognized that these considerations are ""not limited to the employment contract itself, but extend to the broader context of the employment relationship.""

This is because personal liability claims are not limited to the employment contract itself, but extend to the broader context of the employment relationship.\n\nIt is worth noting that some states have recognized exceptions to the general rule that personal liability is not available for wrongful termination.

Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005), the Supreme Court of the United States addressed the issue of exhaustion of state remedies in the context of a federal habeas corpus petition. The case involved Charles Rhines, who was convicted of murder in South Dakota state court and filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, alleging various constitutional violations. The district court ruled that Rhines had failed to exhaust his claims in state court and stayed his habeas petition to allow him to pursue those claims in state court. The state penitentiary warden appealed, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately reversed and remanded the case to the district court.\n\nThe Supreme Court ultimately reversed the Eighth Circuit's decision and held that the district court was required to dismiss Rhines' habeas petition because he had not exhausted his claims in state court. The Court noted that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which governs federal habeas corpus proceedings, requires that a petitioner exhaust all available state remedies before filing a federal habeas petition. The Court found that Rhines had failed to do so and, therefore, his habeas petition was properly dismissed.\n\nThe Court also noted that the AEDPA's exhaustion requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to filing a federal habeas petition and that a federal court may not consider a claim that has not been exhausted in state court. The Court further held that the Supreme Court's decision in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 505 (1982), which allowed a state prisoner to proceed with a federal habeas petition despite the absence of an exhaustion of state remedies, was not applicable to Rhines' case because he had not raised any of his claims in state court.\n\nIn summary, the Rhines v. Weber case established that a federal habeas corpus petitioner must exhaust all available state remedies before filing a federal petition, and that a federal court may not consider unexhausted claims. The case is an important precedent for federal habeas corpus proceedings and highlights the importance of exhausting all available state remedies before filing a federal petition.""}]"
51,"Shortly after taking office, President Bush created by executive order the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, a program aimed at allowing religious charitable organizations to compete alongside non-religious ones for federal funding. Another executive order instructed various executive departments to hold conferences promoting the Faith-Based Initiative. The Freedom from Religion Foundation sued, alleging that the conferences favored religious organizations over non-religious ones and thereby violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The government argued that there was no ""Case or Controversy"" as required by Article III of the Constitution. According to the government, the Foundation had no standing to sue, because the Foundation had not been harmed in any way by the conferences. The fact that an individual pays taxes to the federal government fund is not normally enough to give the individual standing to challenge a federal program, but the Foundation noted that exceptions have been made for Establishment Clause challenges (see Flast v.

The court found that the remedies available under the CWA, federal oversight, and withholding of funds from noncompliant states, are very similar to the remedies addressed by the court in Blessing, and therefore, the court's decision in Blessing practically compels the conclusion that the Directors are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on this ground.

The court found that Dr. Williams' determination was based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, and the jury resolved the conflicting testimony in favor of Dr. Williams.\n\nDr. Williams' testimony was based on the 0.106% BAC result taken at 5:50 a.m., which was before the accident occurred at 2:11 a.m. Dr. Williams used a mathematical formula to calculate the BAC at the time of the accident based on the time difference between the two tests.

The doctrine is often applied in cases involving novel legal issues or issues that are likely to arise again in the future.\n\nHowever, the CRER doctrine is not a catch-all exception to the mootness doctrine, and it is typically applied only in limited circumstances. For example, in Doe v. Doe, the Hawaii Supreme Court noted that the CRER doctrine is separate and distinct from the mootness doctrine, and that the two doctrines are not mutually exclusive.

At about 10:30 A.M., Byars observed a group of four to six people including noted activist Fred L.

Byars walked through Newberry’s and through the front entrance, where he observed a group of ten or twelve people congregated in one area.

Byars observed the group for a minute or so from inside Newberry’s, then left the store and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk. Some of the group began to leave. Byars repeated his command, and Shuttlesworth asked, “You mean to say we can’t stand here on the sidewalk?” Three more officers arrived on the scene, and Byars told the group that they would have to clear the sidewalk or he would arrest them for obstructing its use. By this point, only Shuttlesworth remained at the scene. Shuttlesworth repeated his question, and Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then attempted to walk into Newberry’s, but Byars followed him in and arrested him. Shuttlesworth offered no resistence. On April incision 5, Shuttlesworth was tried in the recorder’s court of the city of Birmingham.

By [/INST]  The majority\'s interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) is flawed for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the majority misinterprets the scope of the FD&C Act\'s safe harbor provisions. The safe harbor is not limited to acts that only produce information for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but rather protects all acts that are reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. Merck & Co. v. Thompson, 545 U.S. 239, 208, 125 S.Ct. 2372, 2385 (2005). The majority\'s reading is inconsistent with this precedent and ignores the broad language of the safe harbor provision.\n\nSecond, the majority\'s decision is at odds with the Supreme Court\'s decision in Merck, which held that the safe harbor applies to ""all acts reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA."" Id. at 208, 125 S.Ct. at 2385. The majority\'s interpretation would limit the safe harbor to only those acts that are directly related to the FDA\'s approval process, which is a narrow and unreasonable reading of the statute.\n\nThird, the majority\'s decision is inconsistent with the Federal Circuit\'s precedent on the safe harbor. In Abtox, Inc. v. Exitron Corp., 122 F.3d 1019, 1030 (Fed.Cir.1997), the Federal Circuit held that the safe harbor applies to data used for purposes other than FDA approval, such as for fundraising and other business purposes. The majority\'s decision is at odds with this precedent and would undermine the broad protection afforded by the safe harbor.\n\nFourth, the majority\'s decision is based on an overly narrow reading of the FD&C Act\'s language and ignores the statute\'s broader purposes. The FD&C Act was enacted to ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, but it also serves to promote innovation and development of new drugs. By limiting the safe harbor to only those acts that are directly related to the FDA\'s approval process, the majority\'s decision would undermine these broader goals and create unnecessary obstacles to drug development.\n\nFinally, the majority\'s decision is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\'s decision in Pfizer, Inc. v. Doe, 552 U.S. 337, 345, 128 S.Ct. 1304, 1309 (2008), which held that the safe harbor applies to all ""acts reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA."" The majority\'s reading would limit the safe harbor to only those acts that are directly related to the FDA\'s approval process, which is a narrow and unreasonable reading of the statute.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority\'s decision is flawed because it misinterprets the scope of the FD&C Act\'s safe harbor provisions, ignores precedent from the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit, and undermines the broader goals of the statute.

In Utahns for Better Transp. v.

The court found that the company had a recognized interest in the lawsuit because it had a direct economic interest in the outcome of the litigation. The court noted that the company’s economic interests were directly impaired by the government agency’s failure to take action, and that the company had a legitimate interest in seeking judicial review of the agency’s decision.\n\nThe court also held that the company’s interests were not adequately represented by existing parties. The court found that the company’s interests were not identical to those of the existing parties, and that the company had a unique perspective on the issues at hand. The court noted that the company had a direct economic interest in the outcome of the litigation, and that its interests were not adequately represented by the existing parties.\n\nThe court’s holding in Utahns for Better Transp. v.

[/INST]  In 2001, President Bush announced that he would lift a temporary ban on Mexican trucking companies operating in the United States once new regulations were developed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to address safety inspections and applications for transporting materials. Congress specified certain standards that these regulations would need to meet before it would appropriate funding for the registration of new carriers.\n\nIn preparing these regulations, the FMCSA conducted an Environmental Assessment (EA) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the new regulations. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal agencies are required to perform an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of policies that are likely to have significant environmental effects. However, if an agency determines that its policies will not have significant environmental impacts, it may perform a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) as it did in this case.\n\nPublic Citizen, a watchdog group that monitors government actions, challenged the FMCSA's decision to perform an EA in federal court. Public Citizen argued that, given the expected large number of Mexican trucks that would be admitted into the United States once the regulations were issued, the FMCSA should have considered the environmental impact of the increased number of trucks in addition to the more limited impact of the safety inspections. Public Citizen maintained that the environmental impact of the trucks would have been significant enough to warrant an EIS, and therefore the FMCSA had violated NEPA by not conducting the more stringent study.\n\nThe district court sided with the FMCSA, holding that, while the passage of the regulations was necessary before the trucks could enter the country, the FMCSA did not have control over those trucks and therefore did not have to account for them in its Environmental Assessment. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed this decision, finding that the FMCSA did have control over the trucks and therefore should have considered their environmental impact in its EA.\n\nIn summary, the FMCSA's decision to perform an EA rather than an EIS was upheld in court, as the agency did not have control over the Mexican trucks it was regulating. However, the decision highlights the importance of considering the potential environmental impacts of federal policies, particularly when they may affect a large number of vehicles or have significant environmental consequences.""}]"

Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). A law is retrospective if it changes “the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.” Id.

The prohibition against ex post facto laws [/INST]  In this case, the state revoked the defendant's probation after he was found to have violated the terms of his probation. The defendant argued that the revocation was unconstitutional because it was based on a new law that was applied retroactively, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court rejected this argument, holding that the law at issue was not retrospective and did not disadvantage the defendant in any way.\n\nThe court explained that the Ex Post Facto Clause only applies to criminal laws that are retrospective in nature, meaning they change the legal consequences of acts completed before their effective date. In a probation revocation case, the acts that are completed are the underlying offense, and the legal consequences of those acts are determined at the time the offense was committed. Therefore, the law at issue in this case was not retrospective and did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\nThe court also noted that the defendant's argument was based on a misunderstanding of the nature of probation revocation proceedings. Probation revocation is not a criminal trial, but rather a proceeding to determine whether the defendant has violated the terms of his probation. As such, the defendant's rights are not the same as they would be in a criminal trial, and the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply in the same way.\n\nIn conclusion, the court held that the state's revocation of the defendant's probation was not unconstitutional under the Ex Post Facto Clause. The law at issue was not retrospective in nature, and it did not disadvantage the defendant in any way. Therefore, the defendant's probation was properly revoked.""}]"

The employees appealed 54 days after the judgment was entered, making their appeal untimely.\n\nThe court noted that the FCA provides a limited window of time for filing an appeal, and the Second Circuit has consistently held that it lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals filed outside of that window. The court further explained that the FCA is a federal statute that provides a private right of action for individuals to bring qui tam actions on behalf of the government, and the limitations period for filing an appeal is a jurisdictional requirement that must be strictly enforced.\n\nTherefore, the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the employees' appeal, and the case was dismissed.""}]"

[/INST]  In 1986, the City of New York amended its Human Rights Law to prohibit discrimination in public places, including social clubs and invite institutions that hosted dining regularly and received funding from non-members to promote business interests. However, the amendment did not apply to religious, charitable, and educational organizations. The New York State Club Association, a group of 125 clubs, challenged the new law on the grounds that it violated their associational rights provided by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nThe trial court ruled in favor of the city, and the decision was upheld by both the state appellate court and the New York Court of Appeals. The courts found that the city\'s compelling interest in eliminating discrimination justified the restrictions on associational rights.\n\nThe case highlights the tension between the right to associate and the right to be free from discrimination. While the First Amendment protects the right to associate with others, it does not necessarily protect the right to discriminate against certain groups. On the other hand, the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from discrimination, including discrimination based on race, gender, and other characteristics. The New York City Human Rights Law seeks to balance these competing interests by prohibiting discrimination in public places, including social clubs and invite institutions, while exempting religious, charitable, and educational organizations.\n\nThe case also underscores the importance of considering the compelling interests of the state in regulating associational rights. In this case, the city argued that the amendment was necessary to combat discrimination in public places, which is a compelling interest that outweighs any potential infringement on associational rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of New York City v. New York State Club Association demonstrates the complex interplay between the right to associate and the right to be free from discrimination. While the First Amendment protects the right to associate, it does not necessarily protect the right to discriminate against certain groups. On the other hand, the Fourteenth Amendment protects individuals from discrimination, including discrimination based on race, gender, and other characteristics. The case highlights the importance of considering the compelling interests of the state in regulating associational rights and the need to balance these interests with the right to associate.'}]"
