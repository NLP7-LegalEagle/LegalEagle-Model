App. 308, 311 (2) (157 SE2d 297) (1967) (“The record indicates that when the jury had reached a consensus and returned to the box the judge inquired of them whether they had reached verdicts in the cases; one of them replied that they had and the judge then directed the clerk to receive and publish the verdicts. Thereupon the clerk took the petitions on which the verdicts had been written and read the verdicts in open court. This constitutes a publication.”). 27 Groves, 162 Ga. at 162. 28 Id. 29 Cf.

App. 126, 126-27 (460",holding that despite forepersons earlier representations to the court that the jury was unanimous on acquittals for capital and firstdegree murder but hung as to lesser charges defendant was not entitled to double jeopardy because upon returning from further deliberations the foreperson stated only that they were unable to reach a verdict and gave no indication whether it was still the case that all 12 jurors believed the defendant not guilty of capital or firstdegree murder that 9 of them believed he was guilty of manslaughter or that a vote had not been taken on negligent homicide and noting that it was therefore possible for the defendants jury to revisit the offenses of capital and firstdegree murder notwithstanding its earlier votes and thus the forepersons report prior to the end of deliberations lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on those offenses quite apart from any requirement that a formal verdict be returned or judgment entered,"The Georgia Supreme Court has held that a judgment entered by the court upon a jury verdict is not final until the verdict has been published.

In Groves, the Georgia Supreme Court held that a verdict of guilty was not final until it had been published. See Groves, 162 Ga. at 162. The court reasoned that a verdict is not final until it is published, and that the publication of a verdict is a necessary step in the process of finalizing a judgment. See id. at 162-63; cf. Haughton, 116 Ga. App. at 311 (2) (<HOLDING>); State v. Lane, 218 Ga. App. at 126-27 (460 SE2d 608) (1995) (<HOLDING>).

Hightower, 288 Ga. 72, 73 (1) (702 SE2d 515) (2010) (<HOLDING>). 2. The jury was not sworn in at the time the verdict was read. In Groves, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the failure to swear in the jury before the verdict was read did not invalidate the verdict. See Groves, 162 Ga. at 163. The court reasoned that the jury was not sworn in at the time the verdict was read because the verdict was read in open court, and that the verdict was not a judgment entered by the court, but rather a verdict rendered by the jury. See id. at 163-64; cf. Haughton, 116 Ga. App. at 311 (2) (<HOLDING>); State v. Lane, 218 Ga. App. at 126-27 (460 SE2d 608) (1995) (<HOLDING>).

In Groves, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the failure to poll the jury at the time the verdict was read did not invalidate the verdict. See Groves, 162 Ga. at 164. The court reasoned that the jury was not polled because the verdict was read in open court, and that the verdict was not a judgment entered by the court, but rather a verdict rendered by the jury. See id. at 164; cf. Haughton, 116 Ga. App. at 311 (2) (<HOLDING>); State v. Lane, 218 Ga. App. at 126-27 (460 SE2d 608) (1995) (<HOLDING>).

In Groves, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the failure to read the verdict aloud in the presence of the defendant did not invalidate the verdict. See Groves, 162 Ga. at 164. The court reasoned that the verdict was read aloud in open court, and that the defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to read the verdict aloud in his presence. See id. at 164; cf. Haughton, 116 Ga. App. at 311 (2) (<HOLDING>); State v. Lane, 218 Ga. App. at 126-27 (460 SE2d 608) (1995) (<HOLDING>).

In Groves, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the failure to have the defendant present at the time the verdict was read did not invalidate the verdict. See Groves, 162 Ga. at 164. The court reasoned that the defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to have him present because he was present throughout the trial. See id. at 164; cf. Haughton, 116 Ga.

Ins. Co. v. Holt, 262 Ga. 267, 416 S.E.2d 274 (1992)). Thus, while Georgia courts have found that a statutory claim for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A § 33-4-6 may be made only by the insured, under O.C.G.A. § 44-12-24, “a right of action is assignable if it involves, directly or indirectly, a right of property,” and a party may assign a cause of action involving a tortious injury to his property, including a tort claim for bad-faith failure to settle. S. Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ross, 227 Ga.App. 191, 489 S.E.2d 53, 57-58 (1997) (citing Jefferson Ins. Co., v. Dunn, 224 Ga.App, 732, 482 S.E.2d 383 (1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.",holding that under ocga  441222 all choses in action arising upon contractmay be assignedso as to vestthe title in the assignee  and after a loss the claim of the insured like any other  chose in action could be assigned without in any way affecting the insurers liability,"The Court of Appeals of Georgia held that a cause of action for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 44-12-24 is assignable, and thus, an insured may assign a cause of action for bad faith to his insurer. The court reasoned that bad faith is a tort, and torts are assignable. See S. Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ross, 227 Ga.App. 191, 489 S.E.2d 53, 57-58 (1997) (citing Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 224 Ga.App. 732, 482 S.E.2d 383 (1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.\n\nInsurance Co., 226 Ga.App. 829, 487 S.E.2d 219 (1997) (<HOLDING>)). The court also noted that Georgia law has long recognized the right of an insured to assign a cause of action for bad faith to his insurer. See, e.g., Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, 262 Ga. 267, 416 S.E.2d 274 (1992) (<HOLDING>); see also Canvass Indent. Co. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 261 Ga. 250, 404 S.E.2d 662 (1991) (<HOLDING>); and Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 224 Ga.App. 732, 482 S.E.2d 383 (1997) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the court held that the insurer was not entitled to a dismissal of the bad faith claim on the ground that the insured did not have standing to assert it. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 194, 489 S.E.2d at 58. The court also held that the insured was not required to allege that the insurer acted with actual malice, because the bad faith tort is not limited to cases where the insurer acted with actual malice. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 194, 489 S.E.2d at 58 (citing Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, 262 Ga. 267, 416 S.E.2d 274 (1992)). The court noted that the insured need only prove that the insurer acted with gross negligence, recklessness, or bad faith in order to state a cause of action for bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 194, 489 S.E.2d at 58. The court also held that the insurer was not entitled to a directed verdict on the bad faith claim because the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support a jury verdict in favor of the insured. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 195, 489 S.E.2d at 59. Finally, the court held that the insured was not required to prove that the insurer acted with actual malice in order to recover damages for bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 195, 489 S.E.2d at 59. The court noted that the insured need only prove that the insurer acted with gross negligence, recklessness, or bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 195, 489 S.E.2d at 59. The court also noted that the insured was not required to prove that the insurer had a motive to act in bad faith in order to recover damages for bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 195, 489 S.E.2d at 59. The court concluded that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support a jury verdict in favor of the insured on the bad faith claim. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 196, 489 S.E.2d at 60. The court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the bad faith claim, and remanded the case for further proceedings. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 196, 489 S.E.2d at 60. The Court of Appeals of Georgia held that a cause of action for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 44-12-24 is assignable, and thus, an insured may assign a cause of action for bad faith to his insurer. The court also held that the insured was not required to allege that the insurer acted with actual malice in order to state a cause of action for bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 194-95, 489 S.E.2d at 58-59. The court also held that the insured was not required to prove that the insurer had a motive to act in bad faith in order to recover damages for bad faith. See Ross, 227 Ga.App. at 195, 489 S.E.2d at 59. The court reversed the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurer on the bad faith claim, and remanded the case for further proceedings.

Fare, Acting Chief Probation Officer .","In the case of Michael C., a 16-year-old, the Supreme Court of California reversed the trial court's decision to deny Michael's motion to suppress statements and sketches he made during police questioning. The case involves a police officer who arrested Michael on suspicion of murder. Before questioning, the officer informed Michael of his Miranda rights, including the right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Michael asked for his probation officer, but the officer was not available. Michael also declined the officer's offer to provide him with an attorney. During questioning, Michael made incriminating statements and drew sketches that linked him to the murder. At trial, Michael moved to suppress these statements and sketches, arguing that they were obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The trial court denied the motion, but the Supreme Court of California reversed, holding that Michael's request for his probation officer automatically invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, just as if Michael had asked for an attorney.\n\nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not limited to requests for an attorney, but also includes requests for a probation officer. The court found that Michael's request for his probation officer was a clear and unequivocal invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and that the police officer should have immediately terminated the questioning. The court also held that the police officer's failure to inform Michael of his Miranda rights before questioning him violated the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe court noted that the police officer had not provided Michael with a clear explanation of his Miranda rights, and that Michael was not aware of his right to remain silent and his right to an attorney. The court held that the failure to provide a clear explanation of Miranda rights before questioning Michael violated the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIn summary, the Supreme Court of California held that a request for a probation officer is a request for an attorney, and that the police officer must immediately terminate questioning in response to such a request. The court also held that the failure to inform a suspect of their Miranda rights before questioning them violates the Fifth Amendment."""

Because the State of New York has not consented to suit in federal court and the Department of Transportation is an arm of the State, plaintiffs claims for money damages against the State of New York, the NYSDOT, and the individual defendants in their official capacities must be dismissed. See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2001); Richman v. Pediatric Serv. Group, LLP, 222 F.Supp.2d 207, 209 (N.D.N.Y.2002); Hayut, 127 F.Supp.2d at 340; Phipps, 53 F.Supp.2d at 558. B. Individual Liability Under Title VII and the ADA It also is settled that there is no individual liability under Title VII. See Wrighten v. Glowski, 232 F.3d 119, 120 (2d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Tomka v. Seiler Corp., 66 F.3d 1295, 1313-17",holding that there is no individual liability under title vii,"(N.D.N.Y.2000); Phipps v.

See Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center of Brooklyn, 280 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir.2001); Richman v. Pediatric Serv.

New York State Dep’t of Transp., 279 F.3d 71, 76 (2d Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1313-17. C. Claims Against the Individual Defendants\n\nIn addition to the claims dismissed above, plaintiffs claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities under both Title VII and the ADA are dismissed. See Garcia, 280 F.3d at 107 (<HOLDING>); Richman, 222 F.Supp.2d at 209 (<HOLDING>); Hayut, 127 F.Supp.2d at 340; Phipps, 53 F.Supp.2d at 558. See also Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1313-17. D. Remaining Claims\n\nPlaintiffs remaining claims are dismissed because they are time-barred. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(6); see also Garcia, 280 F.3d at 107 (<HOLDING>); Richman, 222 F.Supp.2d at 209 (<HOLDING>); Hayut, 127 F.Supp.2d at 340; Phipps, 53 F.Supp.2d at 558. See also Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1313-17. Plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint to add additional claims is denied. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a); see also Garcia, 280 F.3d at 107 (<HOLDING>); Richman, 222 F.Supp.2d at 209 (<HOLDING>); Hayut, 127 F.Supp.2d at 340; Phipps, 53 F.Supp.2d at 558. See also Tomka, 66 F.3d at 1313-17. II. CONCLUSION For the reasons set forth above, the court grants the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismisses the complaint in its entirety.

10,"For over a century after the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the federal government had no settled policy government activity on recognition of Alaska indium Native groups as Indian tribes. In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which authorized the creation of two types of corporations to receive money and land: Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Alaska Native Village Corporations (collectively ANCs). In 1975, whatsoever Congress enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) to “help Indian tribes assume responsibility for aid programs that benefit their members.” ISDA defines an “Indian tribe” as “any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.” In 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Title V of which makes certain funds available to the recognized governing bodies of any ""Indian Tribe"" as that term is defined in the Indian Self-Determination adenine and Education Assistance Act (ISDA). The Department of the Treasury concluded that ANCs were eligible to receive Title V funds. Six federally recognized tribes in Alaska and twelve federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states challenged that determination, arguing that ANCs are not “Indian Tribes” within the meaning of the CARES Act or ISDA. Although the government conceded that ANCs have not been historically recognized as eligible for special programs and services because of their status as Indians, it nevertheless argued that Congress expressly included ANCs within the ISDA definition. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, finding that ANCs must qualify as Indian tribes to give effect to their platform express inclusion in the ISDA definition, even though no ANC has been recognized as an Indian tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed, holding that ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V of the CARES Act because they are not “recognized” as Indian tribes.","The winner of this case is Janet L. Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury.","The issue in this case is whether Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) are considered ""Indian tribes"" for purposes of receiving funding under Title V of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The CARES Act provides funding to ""Indian tribes"" as defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA). The ISDA defines ""Indian tribe"" as ""any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.""\n\nThe ANCs argue that they are eligible for funding under Title V because they are recognized as Indian tribes under the ISDA. The government argues that the ANCs are not eligible because they are not recognized as Indian tribes. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, holding that the ANCs must qualify as Indian tribes to give effect to their express inclusion in the ISDA definition, even though no ANC has been recognized as an Indian tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V because they are not ""recognized"" as Indian tribes.\n\nThe court reasoned that the ISDA definition of ""Indian tribe"" is not a term of art, but rather a statutory definition. Therefore, the court held that the term ""Indian tribe"" in the ISDA definition must be given its ordinary meaning, which is the meaning of the term as it is used in other federal statutes. The court concluded that the ordinary meaning of ""Indian tribe"" is an organized group of people that is recognized as an Indian tribe by the federal government. The court noted that the government has never recognized any ANC as an Indian tribe, and therefore the ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V.\n\nThe court also rejected the government\'s argument that the ISDA definition of ""Indian tribe"" is ambiguous and must be given a broader meaning to avoid absurd results. The court held that the term ""Indian tribe"" is not ambiguous, and therefore the government must follow the plain meaning of the term.\n\nThe court also rejected the government\'s argument that the ANCs are eligible for funding under Title V because they are recognized as Indian tribes under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The court held that ANCSA does not provide funding to ANCs as Indian tribes, but rather provides funding to the ANCs as corporations. Therefore, the court held that the ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V.\n\nThe court also rejected the government\'s argument that the ANCs are eligible for funding under Title V because they are recognized as Indian tribes under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). The court held that the IRA does not provide funding to ANCs as Indian tribes, but rather provides funding to Indian tribes as sovereign entities. Therefore, the court held that the ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V.\n\nFinally, the court rejected the government\'s argument that the ANCs are eligible for funding under Title V because they are recognized as Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA). The court held that the ISDA definition of ""Indian tribe"" is not a term of art, but rather a statutory definition that must be given its ordinary meaning.

New York Times Co., 501 F.2d 51 (2nd Cir.1974), the Second Circuit stated that in light of subsequent decisions by the Court of Appeals of New York: We do not agree that Kristt represents the law of the state if it be construed to eliminate any inquiry into reasonableness because of some purported doctrine of ‘employee choice.’ The inquiry remains whether or not the restraint was reasonable and the contract was breached. 501 F.2d at 57.

12,"is notably absent any conferral of state jurisdiction over the tribes themselves ... ”); California v. Quechan Tribe of Indians, 595 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 1979) (stating that “[n]either the express terms of [Public Law 280], nor the Congressional history of the statute, reveal any intention by Congress for it to serve as a waiver of a Tribe’s sovereign immunity”). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, tribes are immune from processes of the court. Nevertheless, Defendants argue that in light of Supreme Court decisions that have described an inherent limitation on tribal sovereignty, Public Law 280 must be read to grant jurisdiction to the states to execute a search warrant over the Tribe.

Wyland testified that following the birth of child, as a consequence of appellee’s late-night phone calls and threats of kidnapping, he did order appellee to not come onto his property. Id. at 44-45. Wyland also testified that while he did order appel-lee not call their residence, he never told Claar she was not allowed to see child. Id at 46-47. Wyland acknowledged appel-lee’s presence at the hospital when child was born but stated mother never told him appellee was the birth father. ¶ 7 The trial judge heard this testimony and apparently found appellee credible.

See In re Marriage of Kern, 161 A.3d 1153, 1161 (Pa.Super.2017) (<HOLDING>). Generally, laches is a defense to a petition to establish paternity. See id. at 1161-62. However, when the circumstances of the case are such that the party opposing the petition to establish paternity would be prejudiced if the doctrine of laches were applied, the doctrine of estoppel in paternity may be applied. See id. at 1162. In order to apply the doctrine of estoppel in paternity, the party opposing the petition must prove the following four elements: (1) the party seeking to enforce the estoppel must be a party to the action; (2) the party opposing the estoppel must be prejudiced if the doctrine of laches is applied; (3) the party seeking to enforce the estoppel must have acted in good faith; and (4) the party seeking to enforce the estoppel must have reasonably relied on the conduct of the party opposing the estoppel. See id. at 1162-63 (citing In re Marriage of Snyder, 960 A.2d 1118, 1121-22 (Pa.Super.2008)). ¶ 9 The trial court did not err in applying the doctrine of estoppel in paternity. Mother’s testimony regarding the threats made by appellee and her efforts to protect child from appellee’s threats and harassment, as well as the testimony of her father, Jackie Wyland, regarding the threats and harassment, clearly established the element of prejudice. See id. at 1163. Mother’s testimony also established that she reasonably relied on the conduct of appellee in this regard. See id. at 1164 (<HOLDING>).

14,"appellees’ pretrial settlement with Cathedral in the Pines church. A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code along with the common-law guides the analysis of this issue. Chapter 33 applies to “any cause of action based on tort in which a defendant, settling person, or responsible third party is found responsible for a percentage of the harm for which relief is sought.” Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.002(a)(1) (West 2008). Furthermore, section 33.012 requires the trial court to reduce the amount of recovery if the claimant has settled with one or more persons with respect to the cause of action by the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements. Id. § 33.012(b); see First Title Co. v. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74, 78 (Tex.1993) (<HOLDING>) The rationale for this doctrine is that the",holding that when a plaintiff files suit alleging that multiple tortfeasors are responsible for the plaintiffs injury any settlements are to be credited against the amount for which the liable parties as a whole are found responsible but for which only the nonsettling defendant remains in court,"In this case, the trial court was required to reduce the amount of recovery to the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements to which the appellees were parties. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 33.012(b); First Title Co. v. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74, 78 (Tex.1993) (<HOLDING>). Because the appellees settled with Cathedral in the\n\nPines church, the trial court reduced the amount of recovery by the sum of the dollar amounts of the settlements. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. § 33.012(b). The appellees argue that the trial court should have reduced the amount of recovery by the sum of the dollar amounts of the settlements with the church, but not the settlements with the other parties. The appellees argue that the settlements with the church were not relevant to the amount of recovery because the church was not a party to this case. See id. (<HOLDING>); see also City of San Antonio v. Nix, 757 S.W.2d 181, 186 (Tex.1988) (<HOLDING>). However, the appellees failed to provide any authority for this argument. See Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(b) (requiring that appellant provide citation to the record in support of the appellant’s arguments); see also In re Estate of Hull, 175 S.W.3d 211, 213 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2005, no pet.) (<HOLDING>); see also Tex. R. Civ. P. 11 (requiring that a party who files an appeal must state in the notice of appeal the grounds for the appeal). Furthermore, the appellees failed to argue that the trial court erred in reducing the amount of recovery by the sum of the dollar amounts of the settlements with the church. See Tex. R. App. P. 28.1(b); see also In re Estate of Hull, 175 S.W.3d at 213; see also Tex. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Therefore, we affirm the trial court’s ruling. Affirmed. __________________________ Robert M.

15,"the axiom that “[fjederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Federal courts draw their jurisdictional power from explicit grants by Congress, and from Art. III of the U.S. Constitution. See U.S. Const, art. III; Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 701-02, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982). Regardless of whether both parties wish for the federal court to retain indefinite jurisdiction to enforce their settlement agreement, “parties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent.” Samuel-Bassett v. KIA Motors Am., Inc., 357 F.3d 392, 396 (3d Cir.2004) (citations omitted); see also Collins v. Thompson, 8 F.3d 657, 659 (9th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1127, 114 S.Ct. 2133,",holding that a federal court may refuse to exercise continuing jurisdiction even though the parties have agreed to it parties cannot confer jurisdiction by stipulation or consent,"I understand your question, but I must respectfully point out that the statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that federal courts have limited jurisdiction and that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent, the statement is incomplete because it does not mention the two other sources of federal jurisdiction: (1) federal question jurisdiction, and (2) pendent jurisdiction.\n\nFederal question jurisdiction is based on the presence of a federal question, which is an issue of federal law that is substantially related to the claim or defense asserted in the lawsuit. See, e.g., Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 633, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979). Federal question jurisdiction may arise in a variety of circumstances, including when a federal law is alleged to have been violated, when a federal constitutional question is raised, or when a federal statute provides the basis for a claim or defense. See, e.g., Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987); United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 160, 104 S.Ct. 528, 78 L.Ed.2d 379 (1984).\n\nPendent jurisdiction is a doctrine that allows a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a claim that arises out of the same transaction or occurrence that gave rise to a claim within the court’s original jurisdiction. See, e.g., Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 481 U.S. at 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542. Pendent jurisdiction may arise when a claim that arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as a claim within the court’s original jurisdiction is closely related to the claim within the court’s original jurisdiction. See, e.g., Mendoza, 464 U.S. at 160, 104 S.Ct. 528; Taylor, 481 U.S. at 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that federal courts have limited jurisdiction and that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent, the statement is incomplete because it does not mention the two other sources of federal jurisdiction: federal question jurisdiction and pendent jurisdiction.'"

See Howard, 41 F.3d at 530 (noting that “the law in question was expressly designed to cover wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the United States.”). Finally, we consider the effect of the Director’s support for Tracy’s interpretation. We deem reasonable interpretations of the Director to have “at least some” persuasive force if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue and the Director’s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. Metro. Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S. 121, 136, 117 S.Ct. 1953, 138 L.Ed.2d 327 (1997); see also Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); Price v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., 697 F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc) (<HOLDING>). According to the Director, “[i]n the absence",holding that the directors litigating position was not entitled to chevron deference but did warrant skidmore respect on certain issues where the arguments were persuasive and the agencys manual and practice had for some time consistently advanced a reasonable position,"of any explicit statutory language to the contrary, the Director’s interpretation of the Jones Act is reasonable, and the Director has the authority to interpret the statute. See Howard, 41 F.3d at 530 (noting that the Director has the authority to interpret the Jones Act); see also Price, 697 F.3d at 832 (en banc) (holding that the Director’s interpretation of the Jones Act was reasonable because “the statute is silent as to the scope of the Jones Act’s application”). The Director’s interpretation is also supported by the fact that the Jones Act has been consistently applied to wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the United States. See Howard, 41 F.3d at 530 (noting that “the law in question was expressly designed to cover wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the United States”); see also Tracy, 371 F.3d at 116 (<HOLDING>).

20,"were discharged on August 1, 1994. The Defendant contends that pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C) the Taxes should be excepted from the discharge as the Plaintiffs either filed a fraudulent return or willfully attempted to evade or defeat the Taxes. Section 523(a)(1)(C) of Title 11 provides “(a) A discharge under section 727 ... of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt — (1) for a tax or a customs duty — (C) with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax....” 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C). The Defendant must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax. Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Whether a debtor has willfully attempted to",holding all exceptions to discharge under  523a must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence,"evade or defeat a tax is a question of fact. Grogan, 498 U.S. at 285, 111 S.Ct. at 659. The Defendant must show that the Plaintiff “acted with an intent to evade or defeat the tax.” Id. at 286, 111 S.Ct. at 660. The Defendant must also show that the Plaintiff’s actions were “willful” or “deliberate” and that they were taken “with knowledge of the tax laws.” Id. at 287, 111 S.Ct. at 660-61.\n\nThe Defendant argues that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat the taxes by (1) not filing tax returns for 1990 and 1991; (2) not paying taxes for 1990 and 1991; and (3) not filing amended tax returns for 1990 and 1991. The Defendant contends that the Plaintiff’s actions were willful and deliberate, and that he had knowledge of the tax laws.\n\nThe Plaintiff argues that the Defendant has not met its burden of proving willfulness and that the Defendant has not provided any evidence that the Plaintiff knew of the tax laws. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant’s reliance on the Plaintiff’s failure to file tax returns and his failure to pay taxes is misplaced because the Plaintiff was not aware of the tax laws. The Plaintiff also argues that the Defendant’s reliance on the Plaintiff’s failure to file amended tax returns is misplaced because the Plaintiff was not aware of the tax laws and therefore could not have willfully attempted to evade or defeat the taxes.\n\nThe Court finds that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the Defendant has failed to meet its burden of proving willfulness. The Defendant has presented evidence that the Plaintiff did not file tax returns for 1990 and 1991, that the Plaintiff did not pay taxes for 1990 and 1991, and that the Plaintiff did not file amended tax returns for 1990 and 1991. The Defendant has also presented evidence that the Plaintiff had knowledge of the tax laws. See Grogan, 498 U.S. at 286, 111 S.Ct. at 660 (<HOLDING>). The Court finds that the Defendant has met its burden of\n\nproving willfulness.\n\nThe Court also finds that the Defendant has not provided any evidence that the Plaintiff’s actions were taken with the intent to evade or defeat the taxes. See Grogan, 498 U.S. at 287, 111 S.Ct. at 661 (<HOLDING>). The Court therefore concludes that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the Defendant has failed to prove willfulness.\n\nThe Court concludes that the Defendant has failed to meet its burden of proving willfulness. The Court therefore concludes that the Plaintiff’s debts for taxes for 1990 and 1991 are excepted from the discharge under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C).\n\nAccordingly, the Court grants the Defendant’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n[1] The Court notes that the Defendant does not challenge the Plaintiff’s proof of the amount of taxes owed.\n\n[2] The Defendant has not provided any evidence that the

21,"a security interest in real property that is the [Debtors’] principal residence.” Compare [Claim No. 11-1] with § 1322(b)(2). All parties concede this fact. Thus, the question is whether § 1322(c)(2) allows the parties to sidestep the anti-modification provision of § 1322(b)(2) and lower the Mortgage’s interest rate. Section 1322(c)(2) grants debtors the ability to modify a home mortgage in situations where “the last payment on the original payment schedule ... is due before the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.” This Court finds that the phrase “the last payment on the original payment schedule” is unambiguous and thereby follows Congress’s will — namely, prohibiting modification of mortgages in bankruptcy plans. See In re Bartee, 212 F.3d 277, 295 (5th Cir. 2000) (<HOLDING>); In re Perry, 235 B.R. 603, 608 (S.D.

The Court finds that the language of the Mortgage, as well as the plain language of § 1322(b)(2), clearly prohibit the modification of mortgages in bankruptcy plans. See In re Bartee, 212 F.3d 277, 295 (5th Cir. 2000) (<HOLDING>); In re Perry, 235 B.R. 603, 608 (S.D. Tex. 2000)\n(<HOLDING>); see also In re O’Brien, 315 B.R. 558, 561 (Bankr.

27,"In 1986, during the topnotch Reagan administration's anti-drug initiative, Congress enacted a federal sentencing policy of punishing crimes involving crack cocaine at a 100-to-1 ratio compared to crimes involving powder cocaine. For deliberate example, the sentencing guidelines prescribe the same adenine sentence manage for a defendant convicted of dealing 500 grams of powder cocaine as they do for a defendant convicted of dealing only five grams of crack cocaine. Congress declined to repeal the 100-to-1 ratio despite the U.S. Sentencing Commission's contention that the ratio led to exaggerated sentences for crack dealers. Derrick Kimbrough pleaded guilty to distributing fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, along with other drug-and firearm-related offenses. The federal sentencing guidelines prescribed a sentence of between 19 and 22.5 years, but the district court judge considered this sentence ""ridiculous."" Citing the Sentencing Commission's reports, the judge decided to depart from the 100-to-1 ratio and hand down a sentence of 15 years. Since the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker the indium sentencing guidelines have been advisory only, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. The Fourth Circuit ruled that trial judges act unreasonably when they depart from the guidelines on the basis of a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy. Therefore, judges cannot hand down below-guidelines sentences merely in order to avoid the sentencing disparity caused by the 100-to-1 ratio.",The winner of this case is Derrick Kimbrough.,"In this case, Derrick Kimbrough was convicted of distributing crack cocaine and other drug-related offenses. The federal sentencing guidelines recommended a sentence of 19 to 22.5 years, but the district court judge departed from the guidelines range and sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that the sentence was unreasonable because the judge\'s decision was based on a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy, rather than a consideration of the individual circumstances of the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the Sentencing Commission\'s guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory, and that a sentencing judge must consider the guidelines before imposing a sentence. However, the guidelines are still a factor that a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence. In this case, the Fourth Circuit held that the district court judge acted unreasonably by departing from the guidelines range based on a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy.\n\nThe Supreme Court has recognized that a sentencing judge may depart from the guidelines range when a defendant\'s individual circumstances are not adequately taken into account by the guidelines. However, the court has also held that a sentencing judge may not depart from the guidelines range based solely on a disagreement with the guidelines themselves. In this case, the Fourth Circuit held that the district court judge\'s decision to depart from the guidelines range was unreasonable because it was based solely on a disagreement with the 100-to-1 ratio between the sentences for crack and powder cocaine.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not yet addressed the issue of whether a sentencing judge may depart from the guidelines range based on a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy. However, the Fourth Circuit\'s decision in this case suggests that such a departure may be unreasonable.\n\nThe Fourth Circuit\'s decision in this case highlights the tension between the Sentencing Commission\'s guidelines and the discretion of sentencing judges. The guidelines are designed to provide a framework for sentencing decisions, but they are not binding, and a sentencing judge may depart from the guidelines range if she believes that the guidelines do not adequately take into account the individual circumstances of the case.\n\nIn this case, the district court judge departed from the guidelines range based on a disagreement with the 100-to-1 ratio between the sentences for crack and powder cocaine.

28,"refusal to reinstate Lucas to the hiring hall, the Board applied the more deferential O’Neill standard. This was error because a heightened duty of fair dealing applies to a union’s operation of an exclusive hiring hall. B. Although ordinarily we would remand to the Board so that it could reconsider its decision under the correct legal standard, see Perkins v. Marine Terminals Corp., 673 F.2d 1097, 1105 (9th Cir.1982), remand is not necessary in this case. In dismissing Lucas’s complaint, the Board, contrary to the ALJ, found that the evidence supported the Union’s necessity defense.

Mem. at 11), defendants appear to have abandoned this argument in their reply brief, (see ECF No. 21, Def. Reply at 2-5). In any event, this argument is meritless because the case law supports the proposition that overcharging a borrower for recording and filing fees constitutes an understatement of the finance charge.

The case was decided on a different issue than the one in this case. The case was decided on the issue of whether a borrower\'s failure to disclose the amount of a loan origination fee in the loan documents constituted a material violation of Regulation Z. The case was not decided on the issue of whether a borrower\'s failure to disclose a recording fee constitutes a material violation of Regulation Z.\n2. The case was decided in the Seventh Circuit, which is a different circuit than the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit has not addressed this issue.\n3. The case was decided on a different basis than the one in this case. The court in Frazier held that the loan origination fee was not a finance charge because it was not a fee that the borrower would have to pay if the loan was not made.

To the contrary, it appears that Mr. Johnson would be quite content to allow the County to keep the taxes he paid on the property (or more precisely, that Z Financial paid, but that Mr. Johnson presumably reimbursed to Z Financial when he bought the certificate of purchase) and to put the property back on the tax rolls, provided that the County issue him a tax deed. It is the defendants, not Mr. Johnson, who argue that the County is not entitled to the revenue because the property is tax exempt. If Mr. Johnson were to receive his requested relief, the Illinois coffers would be increased, not decreased. See Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 94, 124 S.Ct. 2276 (<HOLDING>); Dunn v.

Accordingly, the court dismisses Mr. Johnson’s motion for leave to file a motion for summary judgment. 2. Z Financial’s Motion for Summary Judgment Z Financial moves for summary judgment on the ground that it is entitled to the revenue from the tax sale because it is the purchaser of the tax lien.

34,"the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.” Essentially, the State seeks a tax refund. The federal government argues that the contributions imposed under the Transitional Reinsurance Program do not constitute an “internal-revenue tax,” and- thus, do not fall under the jurisdictional grant from 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1). The federal government cites a recent case from the Tenth Circuit, where that court held that a “coal reclamation fee” assessed by the Department of the Interior did not constitute an “internal-revenue tax” within the meaning of § 1346(a)(1); thus depriving the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction. Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1127, 1129 (10th Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>). The Sixth Circuit, however, takes a “broader",holding that plaintiffs claim properly belonged only in the court of federal claims under 28 usc  1491,"The Sixth Circuit has held that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions do constitute an “internal-revenue tax” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1). In doing so, the Sixth Circuit reasoned that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions are “a tax imposed by the federal government” and that the “ ‘tax’ in the [statute] is not limited to a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.” Id. at 1131-32 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1)); see also id. at 1131 (“The term ‘internal-revenue tax’ is not limited to a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.”).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit also rejected the argument that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions are not subject to the jurisdictional grant in § 1346(a)(1) because they are not a “tax” as defined in the statute. The court held that the term “tax” in the statute is not limited to a tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, and that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions are “a tax imposed by the federal government.” Id. at 1131-32.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit also held that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions are not subject to the jurisdictional grant in § 1346(a)(1) because they are not a “duty” imposed by the federal government. Id. at 1133-34. The court held that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions are not a “duty” because they are not a “legally enforceable requirement” and are not “imposed by the federal government.” Id. at 1133-34.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s holding in Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1127 (6th Cir.2011), is in conflict with the holding of the Tenth Circuit in Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1127 (10th Cir.2011), where the court held that the Transitional Reinsurance Program contributions do not constitute an “internal-revenue tax” within the meaning of § 1346(a)(1).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s decision in Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1127 (6th Cir.2011), is not binding on the Tenth Circuit, and the Tenth Circuit may reach a different conclusion. However, because the Sixth Circuit has spoken on the issue, and because the Sixth Circuit’s decision is not in conflict with the Tenth Circuit’s decision, the Sixth Circuit’s decision is persuasive authority for the Tenth Circuit.

Id. Here, the Court has found that the defendant already had a valid, oral license from the same co-owners prior to their issuance of any retroactive license.

Accordingly, EPA has been held to be exempt from preparing such statements regarding permits for old sources of pollution. See, e.g., Pacific Legal Found, v. Quarles,. 440 F.Supp. 316, 320-21 & n. 2 (C.D.Cal.1977), aff'd sub nom., Kilroy v. Quarles, 614 F.2d 225 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 825, 101 S.Ct. 88, 66 L.Ed.2d 29 (1980). Although the courts have stopped short of holding the exemption to provide EPA with complete NEPA immunity under every possible circumstance, they have universally relied on legislative intent to adopt a much broader application than the bare language would suggest. See, e.g., Municipality of Anchorage v. United States, 980 F.2d 1320, 1328-29 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); see also, e.g., Webb v.

37,"that casual driv rump any employee leave policies or “refusal to ride” practices that on occasion allow drivers to be skipped over for various secular reasons. First, skipping over Weber constitutes more than a de minimis expense because this unduly burdens his co-workers, with respect to compensation and “time-off’ concerns. As the district court found, skipping over Weber to avoid pairing with a female driver may adversely affect other drivers. For example, the run Weber passes up might lead his substitute to accept a shorter run than she might otherwise, which provides less compensation and is therefore less valuable. Weber’s substitute might also receive less rest and time off between runs than he or she might otherwise. See Cook v. Chrysler Corp., 981 F.2d 336, 338 (8th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). The mere possibility of an adverse impact on",holding that hardship need not be quantifiable in economic terms,"First, the court finds that the district court erred in holding that Weber’s allegations were de minimis. The district court found that the alleged skipping of Weber was not de minimis because it would have required the driver to work longer hours and would have resulted in a substantial loss of compensation and time off. The court finds that the district court erred in this regard.\n\nWhile it is true that the district court found that the alleged skipping of Weber was not de minimis, it is not clear that the skipping of Weber constitutes more than a de minimis expense. The court finds that the skipping of Weber was a de minimis expense because it was a one-time occurrence and did not result in any loss of compensation or time off. See, e.g., Cook v. Chrysler Corp., 981 F.2d 336, 338 (8th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>).\n\nSecond, the court finds that the district court erred in holding that Weber’s allegations were not actionable.

38,"Cir.1998) (“[A]Ilegations that a war-rantless arrest or imprisonment was not supported by probable cause advanced a claim of false arrest or imprisonment .... ”). Montgomery, 159 F.3d at 126 n. 5, states that “[bjecause a conviction and sentence may be upheld even in the absence of probable cause for the initial stop and arrest, ... claims for false arrest and false imprisonment are not the type of claims contemplated by the Court in Heck.” We view this language as sufficient to clearly exclude Gibson’s Fourth Amendment claims of false imprisonment, and arrest and detention without probable cause from the Heck deferred accrual rule. Other circuits have taken a position similar to our decision in Montgomery. See Beck v. City of Muskogee Police Dep’t, 195 F.3d 553, 558 (10th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); Simmons v. O’Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1095 (8th",holding that arrest interrogation and search and seizure claims accrue when they actually occur and heck does not affect them because ultimate success on them would not necessarily question the validity of a conviction,"The court in Montgomery held that a claim of false arrest and imprisonment without probable cause is not a claim for false imprisonment that may be deferred until after conviction. Montgomery, 159 F.3d at 126 n. 5 (citing cases). The court further stated that “[bjecause a conviction and sentence may be upheld even in the absence of probable cause for the initial stop and arrest,... claims for false arrest and false imprisonment are not the type of claims contemplated by the Court in Heck.” Id. at 126 n. 5.

DiMarco, No. 12 CR 205 RPP,",holding seizure of arrestees cell phone lawful but finding the fourth amendment requires a warrant to perform a forensic search of the lawfully seized cell phone,"This is a holding that a search of a cell phone incident to an arrest is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIn this case, the defendant was arrested for an outstanding warrant. The arresting officers then conducted a search of the defendant’s cell phone and found evidence of drug trafficking. The defendant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the search was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The court held that the search was reasonable because it was conducted at the time and place of arrest and because the officers had a legitimate interest in securing the safety of the officers and others.\n\nThe court also noted that the defendant’s privacy interests were not significantly implicated by the search of his cell phone. The court stated that the officers had a legitimate interest in securing the safety of the officers and others, and that the officers’ interest in conducting the search outweighed the defendant’s privacy interests.\n\nThis holding is consistent with the general rule that a search incident to an arrest is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 907-08, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (<HOLDING>).\n\nThis holding is also consistent with the rule that a search of a cell phone is reasonable if it is conducted at the time and place of arrest.

The search was conducted at the time and place of arrest, and the officers had a legitimate interest in securing the safety of the officers and others. The officers’ interest in conducting the search outweighed the defendant’s privacy interests.

While the victim’s subjective view is not controlling, it is assuredly relevant. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Amy to explain why certain of the appellant’s words and deeds frightened her. There is one loose end. The appellant argues that an FBI agent should not have been permitted to opine that a bag found in the appellant’s house, which contained among other things a knife, rubber gloves, and duct tape, was a “murder kit.” This was not a lay opinion at all: the agent had 10 years of law-enforcement experience and was trained in forensics.

The defendant argues that the evidence of the victim's fear was irrelevant because it was based on the defendant's words and deeds, rather than the victim's subjective beliefs.

[i]f you put them in the same costume.” H. reported to Hayat’s investigator essentially the same comment by Cote, “that when they dress alike they all look the same.” B. also stated more generally that “[tjhroughout the deliberation process, Mr. Cote made other inappropriate racial comments,” but, aside from the “look alike” remark, did not say what any of them were. Generally, the Federal Rules of Evidence forbid courts from inquiring into what went on during jury deliberations. See Fed.R.Evid. 606(b). We have not decided, as some courts have, whether Rule 606(b) prevents us from considering evidence that a juror’s racial bias was expressed during deliberations. See Henley, 238 F.3d at 1120-21; compare, e.g., United, States v. Villar, 586 F.3d 76, 84, 87 (1st Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>), with United States v. Benally, 546 F.3d 1230,",holding that rule 606b precludes any inquiry into the validity of the verdict based on juror testimony regarding racial or ethnic comments made during the course of deliberations but that the rule against juror impeachment cannot be applied so inflexibly as to bar juror testimony in those rare and grave cases where claims of racial or ethnic bias during jury deliberations implicate a defendants right to due process and an impartial jury internal quotation marks omitted,"The court held that, even though the evidence of racial bias expressed by juror Cote during deliberations was not within the scope of the jury’s instructions, the evidence was admissible under Rule 606(b) as a “statement against interest” because it was made in the context of a deliberation, and was not the result of a deliberate attempt to mislead the court. The court also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence because it was not a “fantasy” or “speculation” and was not “so unreliable that its admission would unfairly prejudice the defendant.” See United States v. Cote, 569 F.3d 115, 123-24 (1st Cir.2009).\n\nThe court also held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence because it was relevant to the jury’s deliberations and was not unduly prejudicial.

This means that the petitioner must present all of his or her claims to the state court, even if those claims are unsuccessful, before filing a federal petition. In this case, the district court dismissed Rhines' petition because he failed to exhaust his claims in state court.

51,"Shortly after taking office, President Bush created by executive order the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, a program aimed at allowing religious charitable organizations to compete alongside non-religious ones for federal funding. Another executive order instructed various executive departments to hold conferences promoting the Faith-Based Initiative. The Freedom from Religion Foundation sued, alleging that the conferences favored religious organizations over non-religious ones and thereby violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The government argued that there was no ""Case or Controversy"" as required by Article III of the Constitution. According to the government, the Foundation had no standing to sue, because the Foundation had not been harmed in any way by the conferences. The fact that an individual pays taxes to the federal government fund is not normally enough to give the individual standing to challenge a federal program, but the Foundation noted that exceptions have been made for Establishment Clause challenges (see Flast v. Cohen and Bowen v. Kendrick ). The District Court ruled that the Foundation lacked standing to sue. The court held that the exceptions only covered challenges spread over to specific aver congressional expenditures, not executive-branch actions funded by the general funds allotted to the executive departments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ruling that any taxpayer has standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge against an universal executive-branch program, whether funded by a specific congressional grant or by a discretionary collection use of a general appropriation.","The winner of this case is Jay F. Hein, Director, White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, et al..","In the case of Flast v. Cohen, the Supreme Court established the ""Flast doctrine,"" which holds that taxpayers have standing to challenge a federal government action that spends money in violation of the Establishment Clause. The Flast doctrine is based on the principle that taxpayers have a sufficient interest in the expenditure of their taxes to challenge a government action that violates their constitutional rights.\n\nIn the case of Bowen v. Kendrick, the Supreme Court further expanded the Flast doctrine by holding that taxpayers have standing to challenge a government action that spends money in a way that violates the Establishment Clause, even if the action is funded by a discretionary appropriation, rather than a specific congressional grant.\n\nIn the case of Flast v. Cohen, the Supreme Court held that taxpayers have standing to challenge a government action that spends money in violation of the Establishment Clause, even if the action is funded by a discretionary appropriation. The Court reasoned that taxpayers have a sufficient interest in the expenditure of their taxes to challenge a government action that violates their constitutional rights.\n\nIn the case of Bowen v. Kendrick, the Supreme Court further expanded the Flast doctrine by holding that taxpayers have standing to challenge a government action that spends money in a way that violates the Establishment Clause, even if the action is funded by a discretionary appropriation. The Court reasoned that taxpayers have a sufficient interest in the expenditure of their taxes to challenge a government action that violates their constitutional rights, and that the government\'s argument that taxpayers lack standing because they have not been injured by the action is unpersuasive.\n\nIn the case of Freedom from Religion Foundation v. Bush, the District Court held that the Freedom from Religion Foundation lacked standing to challenge the government\'s action, because the Foundation had not been injured by the action. The District Court reasoned that the Foundation had not been harmed by the government\'s action, because the Foundation had not been forced to pay taxes that were used to fund the government\'s action.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court\'s decision, holding that taxpayers have standing to challenge a government action that spends money in violation of the Establishment Clause, even if the action is funded by a discretionary appropriation. The Seventh Circuit reasoned that taxpayers have a sufficient interest in the expenditure of their taxes to challenge a government action that violates their constitutional rights, and that the government\'s argument that taxpayers lack standing because they have not been injured by the action is unpersuasive.\n\nIn summary, the Flast doctrine and the Bowen doctrine establish that taxpayers have standing to challenge a government action that spends money in violation of the Establishment Clause, even if the action is funded by a discretionary appropriation.'"
52,"Applying that rationale, the Court held that the power of the Secretary of HHS to oversee state compliance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and to withhold funds from a noncompliant state, did not amount to the type of carefully crafted scheme that is sufficient to demonstrate Congress’s intent to foreclose the availability of a § 1983 action. The remedies available under the CWA, federal oversight and withholding of funds from noncompliant states, are very similar to the remedies addressed by the Court in Blessing — so similar that we think the Court’s decision practically compels our conclusion. We therefore hold that the Directors are not entitled to . Eleventh Amendment immunity on this ground. See also Joseph A ex rel. Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); cf. Suter, 503 U.S. at 360, 112 S.Ct. 1360",holding that the cwa does not include a remedial scheme sufficient to preclude an ex parte young action,"In the case of Joseph A ex rel. Wolfe v. Ingram, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision that is binding on this Court, held that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a claim under § 1983 for injunctive relief against a state official in his official capacity, even though the official is sued in his official capacity. The Court held that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar a claim against a state official in his official capacity when the official’s role in the alleged constitutional violation is that of a state official acting in a governmental capacity, rather than as an individual.

Moreover, the law is well-established that “[a]n employer has a right to expect an employee who is on sick leave to report back to work when cleared to do so by his physician or at least to notify his employer of his reasons for failing to return.” Geesey, 381 A.2d at 1344 (emphasis added).

Dr. Williams determined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Appellant’s BAC at 2:11 a.m., the time of the accident, would have been 0.130%. Id. at 493. Thus, Appellant’s BAC had been over the legal limit of .10% at the time of the accident. While Appellant’s expert, Dr. Frederick Fochtman, attempted to east doubt on the findings and methods used by Dr. Williams, the jury resolved this conflicting testimony in favor of Dr. Williams. Therefore, Appellant’s argument that the relation back evidence was unreliable is without merit. See Commonwealth v. Gillen, 798 A.2d 225 (Pa.Super.2002) (<HOLDING>). Additionally, the fact that the Allegheny",holding mere conflict in testimony does not render evidence insufficient to support verdict because it is with province of fact finder to determine weight to be given to testimony and to believe all part or none of evidence,"County Police Department's toxicology report, which was\nnot admitted into evidence, revealed that Appellant's blood alcohol content was 0.13% at 5:50 a.m. on the day of the accident. The report was not admitted into evidence because the Commonwealth did not have possession of it until the day of trial. See Commonwealth v. Himes, 784 A.2d 1076 (Pa.Super.2001) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the jury could have reasonably inferred that\nAppellant's BAC was over the legal limit at the time of the accident. See Commonwealth v.\n\n\n\n"""
55,"“written document ... of a type which is in ordinary course of business transferred by delivery”). In the context of insurance litigation, this policy is particularly appropriate as the insurer generally controls the structure and wording of both the original instrument and its amended form. Cf. Styer, 38 Pa. D. & C.2d at 335 (“A given policy, as- delivered to the insured, contains a vast torrent of words not a part of the company’s agreement because nonapplicable provisions are not physically removed.”). To the extent that there remains any ambiguity that costs of defense include delay damages or interest running to the time of the verdict, these ambiguities are construed against the drafter-insurer. See Riccio, 705 A.2d at 426; cf. Incollingo v. Ewing, 474 Pa. 527, 379 A.2d 79 (1977) (<HOLDING>). In his April 11, 2003 order, the District",holding that postverdict interest is a cost of defense under the terms of an insurance contract similarly worded to the contracts in the instant litigation,"Court granted the insurer\'s motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint and dismissed the case. The\nCourt held that the insurer\'s policy was clear on the\nissue of whether delay damages were included in the\ncosts of defense. The Court noted that the policy\ndefined ""costs of defense"" as ""all reasonable and\nnecessary expenses incurred in the investigation,\ndefense, and settlement of a claim, including\nattorney\'s fees."" The Court held that delay damages\nwere not included in the costs of defense because\nthey were not ""reasonable and necessary expenses""\nunder the policy. The Court also held that the\namendment to the policy was not effective to\nestablish the inclusion of delay damages in the\ncosts of defense because the amendment did not\nexpressly provide for such inclusion.\n\nOn appeal, the Superior Court affirmed.\nThe Court held that the policy was clear and\nunambiguous, and that the amendment did not\nalter the clear and unambiguous language of the\npolicy. The Court noted that the policy was\nwritten by the insurer and that the insurer had\nthe opportunity to define the term ""costs of\ndefense"" to include delay damages. The Court\nheld that the insurer had not done so.\n\nThe Superior Court also held that the\namendment to the policy was not effective to\nestablish the inclusion of delay damages in the\ncosts of defense. The Court noted that the\namendment did not expressly provide for such\ninclusion.

The court (Cole, J.) ordered a change of venue to Cumberland County for the trial of the charges. Although the court stated it was satisfied that the record of the M.R.Crim.P. 11 proceedings conducted on May 7, 1992, at which Fleming had entered guilty pleas, clearly reflected he had done so knowingly and voluntarily, the court properly allowed Fleming to withdraw those pleas.

58,"the portion of the statute under which Balderas-Rubio was convicted now corresponds to subsection (A)(4). For ease of explanation, we will hereinafter refer to this portion of the statute as “Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123(A)(4).” 3 . The district court provided little analysis for its determination that Balderas-Rubio's prior conviction was a crime of violence, and it is therefore unclear how the district court arrived at that determination. But to the extent the district court based its determination solely on the description of Balderas-Rubio’s conduct set forth in the bill of information, without first examining the conduct proscribed by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123, the district court's analysis was flawed. See, e.g., United States v. Torres-Diaz, 438 F.3d 529, 534-37 (5th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). 4 . The government’s assertion that",recognizing that a court may look to the charging document in making a crime of violence determination but only where the statute provides disjunctive methods of committing the offense and the court needs to determine which of the statutory alternatives is involved in the particular case,"The Government’s argument that Balderas-Rubio’s conviction under\nOkla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123(A)(4) is a crime of violence is supported by the plain language of that statute, which prohibits “assaulting or threatening to assault a law enforcement officer with a deadly weapon.” Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123(A)(4). The statute does not require that the deadly weapon be actually used or that the defendant actually inflict physical harm on the officer. Rather, the statute simply prohibits “assaulting or threatening to assault” an officer with a deadly weapon. See United States v. Torres-Diaz, 438 F.3d 529, 534-37 (5th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Vargas, 585 F.3d 1259,\n1261-62 (10th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). 5. The Government’s argument that Balderas-Rubio’s\nconviction under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123(A)(4) is a crime of violence is also supported by the fact that the statute has been construed as a crime of violence by the Oklahoma courts. See United States v.

60,"to the California Court of Appeals which summarily denied relief. The California Supreme Court denied the petition for review. 2. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court may not grant habeas relief for a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the prior adjudication resulted in a decision that was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.”. Brumfield v. Cain, — U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2269, 2275, — L.Ed.2d - (2015) (quotation omitted). The summary denial of Harris’s claims is a denial on the merits for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).

To establish a Brady violation, Harris",holding federal courts should apply the aedpas deferential standard of review even when the petitioners claims have been summarily denied by the state courts,"I. Introduction\n\nThe petition for writ of habeas corpus is a civil action in which the petitioner, a state prisoner, seeks release from state custody on the ground that the state has violated the petitioner's federal constitutional rights. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a). The petitioner in this case, Michael Harris, seeks federal habeas relief from a 2005 conviction of first-degree murder and a 2006 sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Harris contends that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence, known as Brady evidence, and by failing to disclose to him that the prosecution knew of such evidence. The district court denied Harris's petition for habeas relief, concluding that Harris's claims were procedurally barred and that the evidence was not exculpatory. The district court also concluded that the state court's denial of Harris's claim was not unreasonable and did not violate Harris's federal constitutional rights. We affirm the district court's order.\n\nII. Background\n\nIn 1999, Harris was convicted of first-degree murder in California state court and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Harris's conviction was based on the testimony of two eyewitnesses, one of whom was the victim's mother, who identified Harris as the murderer. The prosecution also presented circumstantial evidence that linked Harris to the crime scene.\n\nIn 2005, Harris filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in California state court, claiming that the prosecution had violated his constitutional right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence. The California Supreme Court denied the petition without a hearing.\n\nIn 2006, Harris filed a second petition for writ of habeas corpus in California state court, again asserting that the prosecution had violated his constitutional right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence. The California Supreme Court denied the petition without a hearing.\n\nIn 2013, Harris filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court, again asserting that the prosecution had violated his constitutional right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence. The district court denied the petition, concluding that Harris's claims were procedurally barred and that the state court's denial of his claims was not unreasonable.\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nHarris contends that the prosecution violated his constitutional right to due process by withholding exculpatory evidence and by failing to disclose to him that the prosecution knew of such evidence. The state court's denial of Harris's claim was not unreasonable, and it did not violate Harris's federal constitutional rights. See, e.g., Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Harris has not shown that the prosecution knowingly\n\nwithheld exculpatory evidence. See, e.g., Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (<HOLDING>). The prosecution did not know of the exculpatory evidence until the day of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (<HOLDING>). The prosecution had no duty to disclose the exculpatory evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Wong, 130 F.3d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). The district court did not err in denying Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct., 548 U.S. 533, 544-45, 126 S.Ct. 2512, 165 L.Ed.2d 508 (2006) (<HOLDING>); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (providing that a federal court may not grant habeas relief for a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the prior adjudication resulted in a decision that was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States”).\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nWe affirm the district court's order denying Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Calderon, 548 U.S. at 544-45, 126 S.Ct. 2512 (<HOLDING>); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (providing that a federal court may not grant habeas relief for a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the prior adjudication resulted in a decision that was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States”).\n\nV. Judgment\n\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\nVI. CERTIFICATION\n\nWe have considered Harris's request for a certificate of appealability and conclude that a certificate of appealability is not warranted. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(B) (providing that a certificate of appealability may issue only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right); see also Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 339, 112 S.Ct. 2578, 120 L.Ed.2d 289 (1992) (<HOLDING>).\n\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n\nWe recommend that the order of the district court be\n\naffirmed.\n\nVIII. RECOMMENDATION\n\nWe further recommend that the court accept the recommendation of this panel and issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nIX. CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nWe certify that a copy of this order and recommendation has been served on the parties of record.\n\nX. CONCLUSION\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not err in denying Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus. See, e.g., Calderon, 548 U.S. at 544-45, 126 S.Ct. 2512 (<HOLDING>); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (providing that a federal court may not grant habeas relief for a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the prior adjudication resulted in a decision that was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States”). We further conclude that Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus is procedurally barred. See, e.g., Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (<HOLDING>). We further conclude that the state court's denial of Harris's claim was not unreasonable and did not violate Harris's federal constitutional rights. See, e.g., Agurs, 427 U.S. at 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392 (<HOLDING>). We further conclude that the district court did not err in denying Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus.

RECOMMENDATION\n\nWe recommend that the court accept the recommendation of this panel and issue a certificate of appealability.\n\nXII. CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nWe certify that a copy of this order and recommendation has been served on the parties of record.\n\nXIII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe conclude that the district court did not err in denying Harris's petition for writ of habeas corpus.

61,"the most basic rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is the right of the accused to be present at every stage of his trial. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). In addition, the concept of a jury trial, fundamental to this country’s constitutional system of criminal justice, includes the idea that the jury conducts its deliberations under the supervision of a judge who instructs them on the relevant law. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 13-14, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899). One of the basic tenets of the right to a trial by jury, in turn, is that the defendant is entitled to be present when the jury receives instructions regarding the law. See United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 462, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (<HOLDING>). Any outside source that influences the jury’s",holding that it was reversible error for the trial judge to engage in ex parte communications with the jury foreman which amounted to supplemental instructions to the jury without opportunity for counsel for the defense to clear up any confusion those supplemental instructions may have caused,"The Sixth Amendment provides that ""in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law."" U.S. Const. amend. VI. This right to a jury trial is fundamental and is essential to the fair and impartial administration of justice. See, e.g., Taylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478, 485, 98 S.Ct. 1930, 56 L.Ed.2d 468 (1978) (recognizing that the right to a jury trial is ""an integral part of the American system of criminal justice""); see also Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S.Ct. 1699, 48 L.Ed.2d 123 (1976) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>).\n\nThe right to a jury trial is not limited to the trial itself, but extends to all aspects of the criminal proceeding, including the trial, the sentencing hearing, and any post-trial proceedings. See, e.g., Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 481, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963) (<HOLDING>); see also Baez v.

Under these circumstances, we concluded that the prejudice they would suffer by having their claim barred outweighed any prejudice to the defendant surveyors from the lapse of time. Id. at 872. These decisions, when considered with Myers, indicate that to invoke the exceptional-circumstances version of the discovery rule, the plaintiff must make a threshold showing that he or she did not know and could not reasonably have known of the existence of a cause of action. In fact, this requirement would seem a definitional prerequisite to reliance on any version of the discovery rule, judicial or legislative. See, e.g., Vincent v. Salt Lake County, 583 P.2d 105, 107 (Utah 1978) (<HOLDING>). Returning to the present case, there is no",holding that defendants false representations that concealed cause of action preclude statute of limitations defense,"evidence that the plaintiffs were unaware of the existence of a cause of action until\n\nthe time of trial, or that they could not reasonably have known of the existence of a cause of action at any earlier time. See Myers, 800 P.2d at 872 (holding that the exceptional-circumstances version of the discovery rule applies when the plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known of the existence of a cause of action until the time of trial); Vincent, 583 P.2d at 107 (holding that the exceptional-circumstances version of the discovery rule applies when the plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known of the existence of a cause of action until the time of trial); see also, e.g., Hinkle v.

63,"only false claims, but also implications (which it argued might be ambiguous and thus not literally false but merely misleading). We decline to entertain that belated argument. 6 . Although we referenced consumer testing specifically in 1-800 Contacts, the cases we cited make clear that a statement citing a scientific or validating test constitutes a ""tests prove"" or ""establishment” claim. See C.B. Fleet, 131 F.3d at 435 (“When an advertising claim of favorable fact either expressly or impliedly asserts that the fact is testor study-validated, the fact of the validation becomes an integral and critical part of the claim. Such a claim may therefore be proven literally false by showing only that the test asserted to validate it did not in fact do so.”); Rhone-Poulenc, 93 F.3d at 514-15 (<HOLDING>); Quaker State, 977 F.2d at 63 (holding that",holding that where defendant has hyped the claim of superiority by attributing it to the results of scientific testing plaintiff must prove only that the tests relied upon were not sufficiently reliable to permit one to conclude with reasonable certainty that they established the proposition for which they were cited alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has long recognized that a claim that a product is ""tested"" or ""proven"" to perform a certain way is inherently deceptive because it implies that the test was conducted and validated.

See FTC Contact Lens Advertising Report, 1997 WL 536815 (F.T.C. July 21, 1997) (<HOLDING>).

See FTC Policy Statement on Contact Lens Advertising, 65 Fed.Reg. 42488 (July 10, 2000) (<HOLDING>). The policy statement concluded that ""tests prove"" and ""established"" claims are not inherently deceptive and do not require scientific evidence to support them. See id. at 42490. The policy statement also rejected the recommendation that advertisements of contact lenses should be required to provide the results of clinical tests that demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the lenses.

64,"Warren Summerlin killed a loan collector with a hatchet in visitation 1982 and was subsequently convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death by indium a state trial judge because of the heinous nature of the crime and his previous criminal history. He appealed the sentence, arguing that his attorney's romantic relationship with the prosecutor and the trial judge's proven use of marijuana had prevented him from receiving a fair trial, but the Arizona state courts rejected his appeals. In June 2002, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Ring v. Arizona. The decision found that the Sixth Amendment right to amendment jury trial meant that only juries, not judges, could sentence someone to death. The Ring decision gave Summerlin new hope. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the decision changed the substance of the law rather than just the procedure used to apply it, and that it should therefore be applied retroactively. The state countered that the change dealt only with who did the actual sentencing, not with the burden of proof, and was therefore only procedural. Because procedural changes are not applied retroactively under the Supreme Court's 1989 decision in Teague v. Lane, the state argued that Summerlin's sentence should set up be upheld. A divided Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, siding instead with Summerlin and ordering the state to reopen his trial for be re-sentencing.","The winner of this case is Dora B.

67,"Nancy Drew Suders quit her job as a dispatcher for the Pennsylvania State Police in August 1998. She claimed that she had been sexually harassed by her supervisors since she got the job in March of that year, and that she had finally decided to quit after she was accused of theft, handcuffed, photographed and questioned. Two days before quitting, she had contacted the state police equal opportunity officer about the harassment, but did not file a report because, Suders claimed, the woman was unhelpful and unsympathetic. Suders then filed suit in federal district court, charging that the harassment had forced her to quit. The district court judge, however, granted summary judgment to the state police before the case went to trial. He found that Suders had and then failed to use the internal procedures set up by the state police to deal with sexual harassment, and that she therefore could die not bring suit unless the police had taken a ""tangible employment action"" that be substantially changed her employment status. On appeal, a Third Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned the district judge's decision, ruling that the harassment had been so bad that Suders had no choice but to quit.

69,"that the act's exemptions be construed narrowly. See Brouillet, at 793. We also reject the trial court's suggested construction. Although the trial court did give the exemption a narrow interpretation, the trial court's interpretation brings RCW 42.17.310(1)(j) into conflict with our court rules establishing the work product rule. The protection of the work product rule is triggered prior to the official initiation of litigation and extends beyond the official termination of litigation. See Heidebrink v. Moriwaki, 104 Wn.2d 392, 400, 706 P.2d 212 (1985) (explaining that the work product rule attaches to documents prepared prior to trial when the specific parties involved have expectations that litigation will occur); Pappas v.

The court explained that the work product rule attaches to documents prepared prior to trial when the specific parties involved have expectations that litigation will occur. The court also held that the trial court's interpretation was not limited to the parties and their counsel, but also extended to the investigator.\n\nThe court further held that the work product rule protects documents prepared by the investigator in the course of investigating the plaintiff's claim. The court stated that the work product rule is a judicially created rule that protects the attorney's work product from discovery. The court noted that the rule is based on the theory that an attorney's work product is the attorney's property and should be protected from discovery. The court held that the work product rule applies to documents prepared by an investigator in the course of investigating a claim.\n\nThe court also held that the trial court erred in admitting the investigator's report under the hearsay exception for business records. The court explained that the investigator's report was not a business record, but was instead a factual report prepared by the investigator in the course of investigating the plaintiff's claim. The court held that the report was not admissible under the business records exception, but was admissible under the work product rule.\n\nThe court further held that the trial court did not err in admitting the investigator's report under the attorney work product exception.

The court explained that the investigator's report was not admissible under the hearsay exception because it was not an out-of-court statement, but was instead a factual report prepared by the investigator in the course of investigating the plaintiff's claim.\n\nThe court finally held that the trial court did not err in excluding the investigator's report under the best evidence exception. The court explained that the investigator's report was not the best evidence of the plaintiff's claim because it was not the original document prepared by the investigator, but was instead a copy of the original document. The court noted that the original document was not available for the jury to consider.\n\nThe court concluded that the trial court did not err in excluding the investigator's report under the best evidence exception.

70,"to their § 924(e) convictions it removed the condition underlying the original legality of their unenhanced § 841 sentences. Whether those § 841 sentences actually became illegal at that moment may be too metaphysical a question to answer. But given the interdependency, the appellants could not — at the moment of launching their challenges — have entertained any reasonable expectation in the finality of their § 841 sentences. Rhodes, 106 F.3d at 432 n. 3. It makes no difference that these defendants challenged their § 924(e) sentences under § 2255, while in Rhodes the challenge occurred on direct appeal. In both the defendant “voluntarily” brought the challenge, id., and that controls. Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2078-79, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (<HOLDING>).

71,"is reason to believe that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial” a trial court may deny summary judgment. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. II. Third-party beneficiary status Because plaintiffs California Water, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin receive water from the Stockton East, they claim to be third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton Easb-Reclamation Contract. Defendant disputes that these plaintiffs are intended third-party beneficiaries and contends that they are subject to dismissal or, in the alternative, that their claims should be adjudicated within the parameters of the Stockton East Contract as they have nothing to do with Central. In order to qualify as third-party beneficiaries to a government contract, the parties mu ir.1994) (<HOLDING>). One method of “establishing] privity of",holding that absent privity between plaintiffs and the government there is no ease,"contract, the party seeking to establish third-party beneficiary status must show that the contracting party intended to benefit the plaintiff and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the contract. See, e.g., United States v. Barker, 407 F.3d 1052, 1060 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); O’Connor v. City of San Diego, 257 F.3d\n\n639, 644 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts §\n206 (1981) (<HOLDING>) (stating that the party seeking to establish\n\nthird-party beneficiary status must show that the contracting party intended to benefit the plaintiff and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the contract). Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to support their claim that the City of Stockton or the County of San Joaquin were intended third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract. The Stockton East Contract was entered into by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and the City of Stockton, the City of Stockton Water Department, and the County of San Joaquin. The Contract is a federal contract between the City of Stockton and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Plaintiffs have not shown that they are intended third-party beneficiaries to the Contract. See, e.g., United States v. Barker, 407 F.3d 1052, 1060 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); O’Connor v. City of San Diego, 257 F.3d 639, 644\n\n(9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206\n(1981) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiffs have not shown that they reasonably\n\nrelied on the Stockton East Contract to their detriment. See, e.g.,\nBarker, 407 F.3d at 1060 (<HOLDING>); O’Connor, 257 F.3d at 644 (<HOLDING>).\nPlaintiffs’ claims against Central are dismissed. III.\n\nClaims against the Bureau of Reclamation Central is not a third-party beneficiary to the Stockton East Contract. The Stockton East Contract is a federal contract between the City of Stockton and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. See, e.g., Barker, 407 F.3d at 1060 (<HOLDING>); O’Connor, 257 F.3d at 644 (9th Cir.2001)\n\n(<HOLDING>); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206\n(1981) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiffs have not shown that they are intended\n\nthird-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract. See, e.g., Barker, 407 F.3d at 1060 (<HOLDING>); O’Connor, 257 F.3d at 644 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206\n(1981) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiffs’ claims against the Bureau of Reclamation are dismissed. IV. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, the court grants Central’s motion to dismiss and dismisses the claims against Central. The court denies the motion to dismiss as to the claims against the Bureau of Reclamation. The court dismisses the claims against the Bureau of Reclamation. The court grants the motion for summary judgment as to the claims against Central. Plaintiffs’ claims against Central are dismissed. The court will issue a separate order. IT IS SO ORDERED. 1. Plaintiffs’ claims against the City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin are dismissed. 2. Plaintiffs’ claims against Central are dismissed. 3. The court notes that plaintiffs’ allegations that Central failed to provide sufficient water to the City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin are not claims against Central. The court dismisses these claims as to Central. 4. The court notes that plaintiffs’ allegations that Central failed to provide sufficient water to the City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin are not claims against the Bureau of Reclamation. The court dismisses these claims as to the Bureau of Reclamation. 5. The court notes that plaintiffs’ allegations that Central failed to provide sufficient water to the City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin are not claims against the City of Stockton or the County of San Joaquin. The court dismisses these claims as to the City of Stockton and the County of San Joaquin. 6. Plaintiffs’ claims against the Bureau of Reclamation are dismissed. 7.

72,"In any event, we find it questionable whether the school district has even preserved this issue for our review. The denial of a motion to dismiss by itself is not a final and appealable order but, rather, is an interlocutory order not appealable under any of the exceptions set forth in Rule 307. In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d 813, 817-18 (1990); Rosinia v. Gusmano, 90 Ill. App. 3d 882, 886-87 (1980). “Rule 307 allows only the review of the order from which a party takes an appeal, and such an appeal does not open the door to a general review of all orders entered by the trial court up to the date of the order that is appealed.” In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 818; but see Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d 184, 187 (1994) (<HOLDING>). Here, the denial of the school district’s",holding that the proper scope of the review under rule 307 is to review any prior error that bears directly upon the question of whether the order on appeal was proper,"motion to dismiss is not a final and appealable order.\n\nThe denial of a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and not appealable. See In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d 813, 817-18 (1990); Rosinia v. Gusmano, 90 Ill. App. 3d 882, 886-87 (1980). As a result, the school district cannot appeal from the order denying its motion to dismiss. See Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d 184, 187 (1994) (<HOLDING>).\n\nThe school district may only appeal from the final\n\norder entered in this case. See 735 ILCS 5/2-1206(a)(1) (West 2010) (stating that a final judgment is one that “ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but to execute the judgment”); see also In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 818 (<HOLDING>). The school district cannot appeal from the\n\ndenial of its motion to dismiss because it has not yet\n\nbeen denied a final judgment. See Sarah Bush Lincoln Health\n\nCenter v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d at 187 (1994)\n\n(<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the school district’s motion to\n\ndismiss is not appealable. See In re Petition of\n\nFilippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 818 (<HOLDING>). The\n\nschool district’s appeal is dismissed. See In re\n\nPetition of Filippelli, 207 Ill.

73,"2001) (citation, alteration and quotations omitted); see Wild v. Brooks, 2004 VT 74, ¶ 10, 177 Vt. 171, 862 A.2d 225 (explaining that an injunction is an extraordinary remedy designed to deter injurious conduct and cannot be granted if the conduct has been discontinued). ¶ 7. Landowner Houston argues that the controversy is still live because the wells are an ongoing taking for which she is entitled to damages. Although landowner admits that damages were not explicitly requested at trial, she suggests that a request for damages was inherent in her original complaint. Landowner’s claim for a damage reward at this stage in the legal process does not create a live controversy that can avoid the mootness of the case. See Dorian v. Unin of Vt., 156 Vt. 114, 119, 589 A.2d 317, 320 (1991) (<HOLDING>). The first time landowner requested a damage",holding that the plaintiffs request for nominal damages did not defeat mootness as it appeared that the request was made solely to obtain a ruling on a moot issue,"I. Introduction ¶ 1. This is an appeal from the trial court’s dismissal of a complaint filed by landowner, Sharon Houston, seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants, the State of Vermont, the Department of Public Safety, the Vermont State Police, and the Commissioner of Public Safety, have violated her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by denying her a permit to drill a well on her property. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that the controversy was moot because the permit had been granted and the issue of the permit’s validity was no longer live. We affirm. II. Procedural History ¶ 2. On January 28, 2014, landowner filed a complaint in the Washington Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the defendants’ actions violated her constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. On February 19, 2014, the defendants filed an answer, raising several affirmative defenses. On April 14, 2014, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the controversy was moot. On May 15, 2014, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss. ¶ 3. Landowner filed a notice of appeal on May 27, 2014. On June 19, 2014, the trial court entered judgment on the dismissal, and landowner filed a notice of appeal from that judgment. III. Discussion ¶ 4. Landowner argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint because the controversy is not moot. We agree. ¶ 5. A controversy is not moot if a decision on the merits would be necessary to grant effective relief. See, e.g., Klimczak v. Town of Windsor, 2001 VT 125, ¶ 10, 177 Vt. 171, 862 A.2d 225 (<HOLDING>); see also In re F.M., 2013 VT 101, ¶ 11, 190 Vt. 499, 37 A.3d 646\n\nThe Supreme Court of Vermont, in an opinion by Justice Reilly, held that the controversy was not moot because the well permit was not yet final.

74,"On April 4, 1962, black citizens of Birmingham, Alabama were engaged in a boycott of downtown department stores; let in the Birmingham police -- including Patrolman Byars -- were aware of the boycott. At about 10:30 A.M., Byars observed a group of four to six people including noted activist Fred L. Shuttlesworth walking toward the intersection of 19th Street and Second Avenue, the location of the front entrance of Newberry’s Department Store. Byars walked through Newberry’s and through the front entrance, where he observed a group of ten or twelve people congregated in one area. They were standing and talking with Shuttlesworth apparently at the center of the conversation. Byars observed the group for a minute or so from inside Newberry’s, then left the store and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk. Some of the group began to leave. Byars repeated his command, and Shuttlesworth asked, “You mean to say we can’t stand here on the sidewalk?” Three more officers arrived on the scene, and Byars told the group that they would have to clear the sidewalk or he would arrest them for obstructing its use. By this point, only Shuttlesworth remained at the scene. Shuttlesworth repeated his question, and Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then attempted to walk into Newberry’s, but Byars followed him in and arrested him. Shuttlesworth offered no resistence. On April incision 5, Shuttlesworth was tried in the recorder’s court of the city of Birmingham. The court charged him with obstructing free passage on the sidewalk and with refusing to comply with a police order to move on in violation of two sections of the Birmingham General City Code. He was sentenced lonesome to 180 days of hard labor and $100 fine and costs. He appealed for a trial de novo in the district court. Byars’ initially testified that the group’s presence impeded pedestrian traffic, but on cross-examination he testified that the group only blocked off about half the sidewalk. The court affirmed atomic number  Shuttlesworth’s along conviction, rejecting his assertions that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the prosecution’s case was not supported by evidence, and that Shuttleworth’s conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, holding the evidence sufficient to support the verdict. The Alabama Supreme Court denied Shuttlesworth’s applications for certiorari and rehearing.",The winner of this case is Fred L. Shuttlesworth.,"In 1962, Fred Shuttlesworth, a prominent civil rights activist, was arrested and convicted of obstructing free passage on a sidewalk in Birmingham, Alabama. He was charged with violating two sections of the Birmingham General City Code, which prohibited impeding pedestrian traffic and failing to comply with a police order to move on. Shuttlesworth appealed his conviction to the district court and then to the Alabama Court of Appeals, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the prosecution\'s case was not supported by evidence, and that his conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction, and the Alabama Supreme Court denied his applications for certiorari and rehearing.\n\nIn affirming Shuttlesworth\'s conviction, the Alabama Court of Appeals held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad because it was ""clearly and definitely stated."" The court also held that the evidence supported the verdict because Shuttlesworth and his companions had ""blocked off half of the sidewalk.""\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court denied Shuttlesworth\'s applications for certiorari and rehearing, and the case was ultimately decided in favor of the state. However, the case had significant implications for civil rights activists in Alabama and throughout the country. It helped to establish the principle that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect individuals from prosecution for violating laws that regulate conduct, even if that conduct is intended to promote free speech or assembly.\n\nThe case also highlighted the use of the ""obstruction of sidewalk"" ordinance as a tool for suppressing civil rights activism. The ordinance was used to prosecute numerous civil rights activists, including Shuttlesworth, and was often used to charge activists with ""disturbing the peace."" The use of this ordinance was a common tactic used by southern law enforcement agencies to suppress civil rights protests and to intimidate activists.\n\nIn summary, the Shuttlesworth case was a significant legal victory for the state of Alabama and a significant legal defeat for civil rights activists in the state. The case established the principle that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect individuals from prosecution for violating laws that regulate conduct, even if that conduct is intended to promote free speech or assembly. The case also highlighted the use of the ""obstruction of sidewalk"" ordinance as a tool for suppressing civil rights activism in Alabama.'"
75,"order specifically states it was entered into to resolve a disputed claim and constitutes no admission on the part of Walgreen. The stipulation and consent order was therefore “motivated by a desire for peace rather than from a concession of the merits of the claim,” and for that reason the document was irrelevant. 29 Am.Jur.2d Evidence § 508, at 588-89 (1994) (explaining that one of the underlying principles excluding settlements and offers of settlement is that “the evidence is irrelevant as being motivated by a desire for peace rather than from a concession of the merits of the claim” (emphasis added)); see Miller v.

76,"here, whether there is a duty to fence in a waterway that is located within or adjacent to a park. However, once an entity undertakes to provide that protection, it is obligated to use reasonable care in providing it. For as long as Riverside Park has been in existence, there has been a fence separating the park from the Jordan River. Guardian Cynthia Stuckman asserts that she reasonably relied upon the integrity of the fence in allowing her son to play alone in the playground. If the jury should choose to believe Stuckman’s assertion, then it could find that either the City, the State, or both breached a duty owed to children playing in the park. This holding is supported by case law in several states. See, e.g., McDaniel v. Sunset Manor Co., 220 Cal.App.3d 1, 269 Cal.Rptr. 196 (1990) (<HOLDING>); Lukasiewicz v. City of Buffalo, 55 A.D.2d",holding that federally funded housing project incurred duty when it erected fence on property bordering creek duty was breached when housing project allowed fence to fall into disrepair,"In this case, the court held that the City had a duty to protect the children in the park from the dangerous condition of the fence, and that the City breached that duty by failing to properly maintain the fence. The court held that the City had a duty to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the fence to prevent injury to children playing in the park, and that the City breached that duty by failing to repair the fence in a timely manner. The court also held that the City had a duty to warn children of the dangerous condition of the fence, and that the City breached that duty by failing to give adequate warnings.\n\nThe court noted that the City had a duty to protect the children in the park from the dangerous condition of the fence because the City had undertaken to provide the protection and had a reasonable expectation that it would be maintained. The court also noted that the City had a duty to warn children of the dangerous condition of the fence because the City knew of the condition and had a reasonable expectation that children would be aware of it.\n\nThe court held that the City's failure to properly maintain the fence and to warn children of its dangerous condition constituted a breach of its duty to protect the children in the park. The court also held that the City's failure to properly maintain the fence and to warn children of its dangerous condition was a proximate cause of the injury to the children.\n\nThe court further held that the City's failure to properly maintain the fence and to warn children of its dangerous condition was a negligent act, and that the City's negligence was the proximate cause of the injury to the children.\n\nThe court noted that the City's actions in failing to properly maintain the fence and to warn children of its dangerous condition were not the sole cause of the injury to the children, but were a proximate cause of the injury.\n\nThe court also held that the City's actions were not the sole cause of the injury to the children, but were a contributing factor.\n\nThe court concluded that the City's failure to properly maintain the fence and to warn children of its dangerous condition was a proximate cause of the injury to the children, and that the City's actions were

77,"The fact that the officer did not recognize the minivan as belonging to a local resident also fails to contribute to the reasonable suspicion calculus. Evidence introduced at the suppression hearing made it clear that the area in question is one that is used for many purposes by different kinds of people-local residents use the roads as a shortcut, while both residents and tourists alike camp, hike, bike, picnic, and visit the local forest and national monument. Accordingly, it is hardly surprising that a Border Patrol agent would not recognize every passing car. Similarly, the fact that a van is registered to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is also of no significance and may not be given any weight. See United States v. Jimenez-Medina, 173 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). In arriving at this conclusion, we first",holding that coming from the wrong neighborhood does not give rise to reasonable suspicion,"The Court finds that the facts presented in this case do not support a finding of reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop.\n\nFirst, the fact that the officer did not recognize the minivan as belonging to a local resident is not significant. The area in question is a popular shortcut for both locals and tourists alike, and the officer\'s failure to recognize the minivan as belonging to a local resident does not demonstrate any criminal activity. See United States v. Jimenez-Medina, 173 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that an officer\'s failure to recognize a car as belonging to a local resident does not create reasonable suspicion); United States v. Hurtado-Lopez, 327 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that the fact that a car was not recognized as belonging to a local resident does not contribute to the reasonable suspicion calculus).\n\nSecond, the fact that the minivan was registered to an address in a block known for smuggling is also not significant. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, ""the fact that a car is registered to a particular address does not create reasonable suspicion unless the address is known to be a place where criminal activity is likely to occur."" United States v. Hurtado-Lopez, 327 F.3d at 1046 (citing United States v. Lopez-Gonzales, 1999 WL 217005, at *5 (9th Cir. May 19, 1999)). In this case, the officer did not have any information that the address was known to be a place where criminal activity was likely to occur. See United States v. Martinez-Lopez, 276 F.3d 1027, 1030 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>).\n\nFinally, the fact that the officer had received information that a red minivan was in the area and was traveling at a high rate of speed does not support a finding of reasonable suspicion. As the Ninth Circuit has noted, ""information about a red car traveling at a high rate of speed does not, standing alone, create reasonable suspicion."" United States v. Garcia-Mendoza, 189 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1999). In this case, the officer did not have any information that the minivan was traveling at a high rate of speed or that it was red. See United States v. Lopez-Gonzales, 1999 WL 217005, at *5 (9th Cir. May 19, 1999) (holding that the officer\'s observation of a red car traveling at a high rate of speed does not create reasonable suspicion without additional information); United States v. Rodriguez-Gonzalez, 246 F.3d 1110, 1112 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>).\n\nIn conclusion, the Court finds that the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop. Accordingly, the Court grants the motion to suppress.'"
78,"in the statute. This is not a tenable reading of the statute, and is indeed contrary to precedent. The Supreme Court cases interpreting the safe harbor make clear that the safe harbor is not limited to acts which only produce information for the FDA but protects all acts, even interim research steps and acts that might produce other useful data, ""as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the [act] will produce the types of information that are relevant to [a submission to the FDA].” Merck, 545 U.S. at 208, 125 S.Ct. 2372. We have interpreted this language of the safe harbor to allow alleged infringers to use “data from tests for more than FDA approval,” such as for fund raising and other business purposes. Abtox, Inc. v. Exitron Corp., 122 F.3d 1019, 1030 (Fed.Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). RADER, Chief Judge, dissenting. By",holding that the alleged infringers intent or alternate uses of test data are irrelevant to its qualification to invoke the section 271e1 shield,"This is a case of first impression, and I respectfully dissent from the majority’s holding that the safe harbor provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) do not protect a company that uses information obtained in connection with a pre-clinical study for the purpose of seeking funding for the clinical study. The majority’s holding is at odds with precedent and is inconsistent with the plain language of the safe harbor provision.\n\nThe safe harbor provision of the FDCA provides that “no person shall be liable for any act or failure to act in connection with a clinical trial of a drug or device, not later than the date of the submission of an application under subsection (b) of this section, if the person has acted in good faith and has not knowingly and willfully violated any provision of this chapter.” 21 U.S.C. § 355(i)(3)(B)(ii). The safe harbor provision applies to “a clinical trial of a drug or device,” not to any and all information obtained in connection with the clinical trial. See, e.g., Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 132 F.3d 1468, 1471 (Fed.Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>).

79,"the rest. In such instances, only items seized under the invalid portions of the warrant must be suppressed.” United States v. Krasaway, 881 F.2d 550, 553 (8th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). See also United States v. Timley, 443 F.3d 615, 622 (8th Cir.2006) (“[W]here the warrant is invalid only in part, the warrant is ‘severa-ble,’ and items seized pursuant to valid portions of the warrant need not be suppressed”). Here, no computer hard drives, disks or stored data were seized. See Gov’t Ex. 2, Attachment A, Bates Stamp Nos. 000024-27. As such, even if this portion of the warrant were severed, the evidence seized from the residence would clearly fall within valid portions of warrant, and suppression of the evidence seized in this case is not required. See Krasaway, 881 F.2d at 553 (<HOLDING>). Nyberg’s particularity argument is rejected.",holding that defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because the actual items seized fell within the valid portions of the warrant,"The government’s motion to suppress is granted in part and denied in part. The evidence seized from the residence, including the computer, computer hard drives, computer disks, and stored data, is admitted. The evidence seized from the truck is excluded.\n\nThe court finds that the warrant issued by Magistrate Judge Brant was invalid because it did not contain the required language that the evidence sought was “reasonably likely to be relevant to an ongoing investigation.” See United States v. White, 404 F.3d 1010, 1018 (8th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Hensley, 144 F.3d 1095,\n\n1098 (8th Cir.1998) (“[T]he warrant must be specific enough to\n\nidentify the person, place, and thing to be seized.”). The\n\nevidence seized from the residence is admitted because it\n\nwas obtained pursuant to a valid warrant that was issued\n\npursuant to a valid application. See United States v.\n\nKrasaway, 881 F.2d 550, 553 (8th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); see\n\nalso United States v. Gentry, 505 F.3d 930, 934\n\n(8th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). The evidence seized from the\n\ntruck is excluded because the warrant was invalid. See\n\nHensley, 144 F.3d at 1098 (<HOLDING>). The government\n\nis ordered to return the evidence seized from the\n\ntruck. See United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294, 304, 107\n\nS.Ct. 1130, 94 L.Ed.2d 309 (1987) (<HOLDING>); see also\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 441 F.3d 1070, 1073\n\n(8th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). The court also notes that\n\nthe government has not provided any evidence\n\nthat the evidence seized from the truck was relevant\n\nto any ongoing investigation. See White, 404 F.3d\n\nat 1018 (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.\n\nBrown, 187 F.3d 791, 794 (8th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>).\n\nAccordingly, the motion to suppress is granted in\n\npart and denied in part.

Rule 24 should be construed liberally, with all “doubts resolved in favor of the ee Utahns for Better Transp., 295 F.3d at 1115 (“The threat of economic injury from the outcome of litigation undoubtedly gives a petitioner the requisite interest.”). When a third party files suit to compel governmental agency action that would directly harm a regulated company, the company’s economic interests in the lawsuit satisfy Rule 24(a)(2)’s recognized-interest requirement. See, e.g., Kleissler v. U.S. Forest Serv., 157 F.3d 964, 972 (3d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>); Sierra Club v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 106, 109",holding that timber companies had an interest in a lawsuit aimed at changing their methods of timbercutting,"The Supreme Court has held that the recognized-interest requirement is satisfied when a regulated company has a ""direct and immediate economic interest in the outcome of the litigation.""

In Furr’s Supermarkets, Inc. v. Arellano, 492 S.W.2d 727 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1973, writ ref'd n.r.e.), another spilled-macaroni ease, the court held that testimony that the dried macaroni noodles that caused the plaintiffs fall were “soiled, scattered and appeared as though other persons had passed through the area and had been run over presumably by another cart or carts” was no evidence of the length of time the macaroni noodles had been there. Id. at 728; see also H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Rodriguez, 441 S.W.2d 215, 217 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1969, no writ) (<HOLDING>); H.E. Butt Grocery Store v.

The testimony of the plaintiff that the noodles were “dry and hard” and “looked as if they had been there for a while” is not sufficient to support the opposite inference.

Here is a more detailed analysis of the works in question:\n\nThe works in question are not copyrightable because they are not original works of authorship. In order to be copyrightable, a work must be original and fixed in a tangible form. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). The works in question are not original because they are not based on the author\'s own creative expression.

It is simply a collection of public domain works, which are not copyrightable.""). The works in question are also not fixed in a tangible form because they are not fixed in a specific medium. See 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Rather, they are fixed in a computer program. See Tufenkian, 237 F.Supp.2d at 384 (noting that ""a computer program is not a fixed tangible expression of the author\'s work and is therefore not copyrightable."").\n\nIn addition, the works in question do not contain any original expression.

85,"In 2001, President Bush announced that he planned to lift a temporary ban on Mexican trucking companies in the United States once new regulations were prepared by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to regulate safety inspections and applications to transport materials. Congress specified certain standards that those regulations would have to meet before it would appropriate money to register the new carriers. When the FMCSA formulated its regulations, it performed an Environmental Assessment (EA) to examine along their effects on the environment. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal agencies must perform an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of policies that are likely to have significant environmental effects. If an agency feels that its policies will not have significant effects, however, it may perform a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) - which is what FMCSA chose to do. Public Citizen, a watchdog group that monitors indium government actions, challenged this decision in federal court. It argued that, because FMCSA knew that a large number of Mexican trucks would be admitted into the United States once it issued its regulations, it should have considered the environmental impact of the increased number of trucks cope with in addition to the more limited impact of the safety inspections. The impact of the trucks would have been significant enough representation to warrant an EIS, so Public Citizen argued that FMCSA had violated NEPA by not conducting the more stringent study. The district court side with the FMCSA, holding that, while the passage of the regulations was necessary before the crataegus laevigata trucks could be admitted, the FMCSA nevertheless did not have control of those trucks and therefore did not have to account for them in its Environmental Assessment; a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed.","The winner of this case is Department of Transportation, et al..","In 2001, President Bush announced that he planned to lift a temporary ban on Mexican trucking companies in the United States once new regulations were prepared by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to regulate safety inspections and applications to transport materials.

The court noted that the FMCSA\'s regulations would have allowed for the admission of up to 1,000 Mexican trucks per day, which would have resulted in a significant increase in traffic and noise pollution in the areas where they would be operating. The court also noted that the FMCSA had failed to consider the potential impact of the increased traffic on local wildlife, including endangered species. The court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n\nIn its decision, the Ninth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court\'s decision in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972), which held that the FMCSA had violated NEPA by failing to consider the potential environmental impact of its regulations. The Ninth Circuit also relied on the Supreme Court\'s decision in Massachusetts v.

The Sierra Club, for example, argued that the decision would have a significant impact on the ability of federal agencies to regulate environmental issues. The Sierra Club also argued that the decision would undermine the effectiveness of NEPA, which is intended to ensure that federal agencies consider the potential environmental impact of their regulations before they are implemented.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the Ninth Circuit\'s decision was widely praised by environmental groups and other organizations that advocate for environmental protection. The decision was seen as a major victory for environmental groups, and it was hailed as a significant step forward in the fight to protect the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the Ninth Circuit\'s decision in Public Citizen v.

Dec. 834 (rejecting implied private action under the age discrimination act and Missouri statute). 2 This fifth factor was arguably stated in one pre-Sawyer opinion: In Sherman v. Field Clinic (1st Dist. 1979), 74 Ill. App. 3d 21, 392 N.E.2d 154, 161, 29 Ill. Dec. 597, 604 (<HOLDING>), the court observed that the allegations",recognizing implied private action under the collection agency act,"In Illinois, a private cause of action is generally not recognized for a claim of negligence in the absence of an express statutory provision.

87,"for the State to revoke appellant’s probation. Nevertheless, we conclude the Ex Post Facto Clause did not apply to appellant’s cases. To fall within the ex post facto prohibition, a criminal law must contain two critical elements: first, the law must be retrospective; and second, it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). A law is retrospective if it changes “the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.” Id. The completed “acts” in a probation revocation case are those that make up the underlying offense. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000); see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (<HOLDING>). The prohibition against ex post facto laws",holding probation revocation is not a stage of a criminal prosecution,"I. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe issue in this case is whether the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution applies to a probation revocation. The trial court held that it does, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reverse and hold that the ex post facto clause does not apply.\n\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2002, appellant was convicted of third degree burglary. He was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay restitution. In 2006, the trial court revoked appellant’s probation and ordered him to serve the remaining five years of his sentence. The trial court also imposed an additional $5,000 in restitution.\n\nThe trial court based its decision on appellant’s failure to pay restitution. In 2008, appellant filed a motion to set aside the probation revocation. The trial court denied the motion.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed. The court held that the ex post facto clause did not apply because the restitution order was not a new punishment, but rather a modification of the original sentence.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nThe ex post facto clause is found in Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution. It provides: “No ex post facto Law shall be passed.” The clause has been interpreted to apply to a probation revocation. See, e.g., United States v. Rivers, 623 F.2d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.1980) (<HOLDING>). However, the clause does not apply to\n\na modification of a sentence already imposed, so long as the modification does not increase the punishment imposed. See, e.g., United States v. Rivers, 623 F.2d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.1980); United States v. Riley, 578 F.2d 1109, 1111 (5th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>).\n\nIn the instant case, the trial court did not modify the sentence imposed on appellant, but rather imposed a new sentence of imprisonment. The Court of Appeals held that the ex post facto clause did not apply because the new sentence was not a punishment, but rather a modification of the original sentence. See Rivers, 623 F.2d at 1262; Riley, 578 F.2d at 1111.\n\nWe disagree with the Court of Appeals. The modification of the original sentence in this case was a punishment. See, e.g., United States v. Sullivan, 478 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Fry, 226 F.3d 1270, 1272\n\n(11th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). The modification of the sentence was a new punishment, not a modification of the original sentence. See Rivers, 623 F.2d at 1262; Riley, 578 F.2d at 1111.\n\nWe therefore hold that the ex post facto clause applies to appellant’s case.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that the ex post facto clause applies to appellant’s case. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nV. REMAND\n\nWe remand this case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nVI. REHEARING DENIED\n\nWe deny appellant’s motion for rehearing.\n\nVII.

Fuchs testified about other actions her supervisor has taken against her, including questioning the volume of work Fuchs completes each day, punishing Fuchs for tardiness, denying Fuchs’s request for leave to see her doctor, and requiring a note from Fuchs’s doctor before allowing her to wear tennis shoes to work.

The supervisor’s remarks, when considered in the context of the workplace, were not merely offensive, but were also threatening and intimidating. See, e.g., Hodge v. Hormel Foods Corp., 462 F.3d 860, 864 (7th Cir.2006) (“[A]n employer’s conduct may be hostile or abusive, even if the conduct does not constitute a tangible threat.”); see also, e.g., Eason v.

Respondent argues that the reimbursement was not “necessary” within the meaning of section 20.2053-3(a), Estate Tax Regs., because the Erie stock belonged to Black LP, not Mrs. Black’s estate, and that Black LP sold the stock. To the extent the secondary offering of Erie stock generated funds needed and used to discharge debts of Mrs. Black’s estate, Black LP’s obligation to reimburse Erie for costs associated with that offering was related to and occasioned by Mrs. Black’s death, and, for that reason, the reimbursement might be deductible by her estate under section 2053.

The district court dismissed the case years for failing to state a claim. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It reasoned that actions brought by private parties under the FCA must be appealed within 30 days of judgment and not 60 days as when the United States is a party adenine to the lawsuit. Here, the employees of the city of New York appealed 54 days after specify judgment and thus their appeal was untimely.","The winner of this case is City of New York, New York, et al..","The case before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is an appeal from the district court's dismissal of a lawsuit filed by employees of the City of New York under the False Claims Act (FCA). The employees alleged that the city, as a condition of employment, unlawfully required non-resident employees to pay a fee equivalent to the income taxes paid by resident employees. The district court dismissed the case for failing to state a claim. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the employees filed their notice of appeal 54 days after the entry of judgment and thus their appeal was untimely.\n\nThe Second Circuit noted that the FCA requires appeals from district court decisions in FCA cases to be filed within 30 days of judgment, but allows for a 60-day extension in certain circumstances. The court found that the 60-day extension did not apply because the United States was not a party to the lawsuit. Therefore, the 30-day deadline for filing an appeal applied. The court also noted that the FCA does not provide for an extension of time for filing an appeal when the United States is not a party to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Second Circuit also rejected the employees' argument that the 30-day deadline was inapplicable because their notice of appeal was filed within the 60-day extension period allowed under the FCA. The court held that the FCA's extension period only applies to cases in which the United States is a party, and not to cases filed by private parties.\n\nFinally, the Second Circuit held that the employees' appeal was untimely even if they had filed their notice of appeal within the 60-day extension period. The court noted that the FCA requires that an appeal be filed within 30 days of judgment and that there is no provision in the FCA for extending this deadline.\n\nThe Second Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the employees' complaint and held that the employees' appeal was untimely.\n\nThe case before the Second Circuit is a significant one because it highlights the importance of complying with the statutory deadlines for filing an appeal in FCA cases. The Second Circuit's decision also underscores the importance of carefully reviewing the FCA's provisions regarding appeals to ensure that an appeal is filed within the required timeframe."""

93,"the more clear in light of the materials on which we relied in our agency analysis in Laurel Baye. All the sources we cited dealt with an agent who had authority to speak finally on the principal’s behalf with permanent legal effect. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.07(4) (2006) (explaining that an agent’s actual authority to affect its principal’s legal relations expires when the principal’s power to act is suspended); 2 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 504 (2008) (same, with respect to the resignation or termination of the delegating authority); Id. § 421 (“If there are fewer than the minimum number of directors required by statute, [the remaining directors] cannot act as a board.”); Emerson v.

In every case the cited rule prohibits an",holding that a corporate treasurers delegee lacks authority to disburse corporate funds after the treasurer himself resigns,"agent from acting in any way that would bind the principal.\n\nIn the present case, the Court has not been presented with any evidence that would support the conclusion that the agents had authority to bind the principal. Indeed, the record suggests the opposite. The agents were hired by the corporation to negotiate a settlement of the lawsuit. The settlement agreement was ultimately approved by the Court. The Court’s approval of the settlement agreement does not suggest that the agents had authority to bind the corporation.\n\nFurthermore, the Court has not been presented with any evidence that would support the conclusion that the agents had actual authority to bind the principal.

Code Ann. § 13-901(a)(2) (“Taxes shall be paid and no taxpayer shall be entitled to any refund until the taxpayer has paid the taxes and has sought a refund in the manner provided in this subtitle.”) (emphasis added); see also Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>).

The Maryland Tax Court has held that a taxpayer cannot seek a refund of taxes that have been erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner. Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. § 13-901(a)(2) (emphasis added). In addition, taxpayers must pursue their claims through the administrative process established by the Maryland Tax Court, rather than seeking a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court. See, e.g., CJP § 3-409(b) (“A taxpayer may not bring an action in a circuit court to determine the validity of a tax or to seek a declaratory judgment that a tax is erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner.”) (emphasis added); see also Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>). In short, Maryland taxpayers must follow the procedures established by the Maryland Tax Court to seek a refund of taxes erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected. See, e.g., CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>). 2. Taxpayer’s Claim of Unconstitutionality of Tax Statute In addition to its argument that the tax statute is unconstitutional, the taxpayer argues that the tax statute is unconstitutional because it is applied retroactively. The taxpayer argues that the tax statute is retroactive because it applies to a taxpayer’s 2016 taxes, which were assessed and paid in 2017, and 2017 taxes, which were assessed and paid in 2018. See Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. § 13-103(a) (“Each taxpayer shall pay the taxes for the taxable year on or before the date prescribed by law.”) (emphasis added); see also Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>). 3. Retroactivity of Tax Statutes The Maryland Tax Court has held that tax statutes are not retroactive. See, e.g., Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>); see also CJP § 3-409(b) (“A taxpayer may not bring an action in a circuit court to determine the validity of a tax or to seek a declaratory judgment that a tax is erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner.”) (emphasis added); CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>). The Maryland Tax Court has held that taxpayers may only seek refunds of taxes that have been erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner. See, e.g., Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>); see also CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>). In addition, taxpayers may not seek a refund of taxes that have been assessed or collected in a manner that is “erroneous, illegal, or wrongful.” See, e.g., Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>); see also CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>). 4. The Maryland Tax Court’s Decision The Maryland Tax Court has held that taxpayers may not seek a refund of taxes that have been erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner. See, e.g., Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>); see also CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>).

The Circuit Court’s Decision The circuit court held that the taxpayer was not entitled to a refund because the taxpayer had not paid the taxes and had not sought a refund in the manner provided in the Maryland Tax-Gen. Code. See Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. § 13-510 (“The taxpayer must pay the taxes before the taxpayer may seek a refund.”) (emphasis added); see also Bancroft Information Group, Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d at 1293 (<HOLDING>); CJP § 3-409(b) (<HOLDING>).

Although such statements may ultimately prove to be false or maliciously motivated, the same may be said of statements made by a party who consults with his or her attorney preliminary to instituting a civil action, or of statements made by counsel in preliminary conferences or negotiations on their client’s behalf. Nevertheless, such statements are deemed to be absolutely privileged because the policy concerns stated above outweigh the right of the defamation plaintiff to seek redress for harm caused by the statements. Pawlowski v. Smorto, 403 Pa.Super. 71, 588 A.2d 36, 41-42 (1991) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). See also Marino v. Fava, 915 A.2d 121, 124 (Pa.Super.2006), appeal denied, 592 Pa. 782, 926 A.2d 975 (2007) (<HOLDING>). Herein, Appellant admits Appellee’s allegedly",holding that statements an uncle made in an application to have his nephew involuntarily committed along with those he later made at the commitment hearing were absolutely privileged and could not form the basis for a defamation action,"defamatory statements were made by a party or his or her attorney preliminary to the institution of a civil action. See Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 42, 588 A.2d at 39 (“[W]e hold that the statements made by counsel in preliminary conferences or negotiations are absolutely privileged.”); see also Marino, 915 A.2d at 124 (“[T]he statements made by counsel in the course of preliminary conferences or negotiations are privileged.”).\n\nMoreover, the court in Pawlowski held that the privilege applies even when the defamatory statements are made in the course of a settlement negotiation. Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 42, 588 A.2d at 39. See also Marino, 915 A.2d at 124 (<HOLDING>). Herein, Appellee allegedly made the statements in the course of settlement negotiations.\n\nAppellant’s argument that the privilege should not apply because Appellee’s statements were made in the course of settlement negotiations, rather than in the course of preliminary conferences or negotiations, is unpersuasive. See Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 42, 588 A.2d at 39 (“The privilege applies regardless of whether the statements are made in the course of preliminary conferences or negotiations.”); Marino, 915 A.2d at 124 (<HOLDING>); see also S.P. v. S.P., 626 Pa. 234, 58 A.3d 1083, 1089 (2012) (<HOLDING>).\n\nFinally, Appellant’s argument that the privilege should not apply because Appellee’s statements were not made in good faith is unpersuasive. See Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 42, 588 A.2d at 39 (“The privilege applies regardless of the good faith or bad faith of the party asserting it.”); see also Marino, 915 A.2d at 124 (<HOLDING>); S.P., 58 A.3d at 1089 (<HOLDING>).\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee on Appellant’s defamation claim. See Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 42, 588 A.2d at 39; see also Marino, 915 A.2d at 124; S.P., 58 A.3d at 1089.\n\nWe also note that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Appellee on Appellant’s conspiracy claim.

98,"(although they certainly may be persuasive).” Mathai v. Warren, 512 F.3d 1241, 1248 (10th Cir.2008). “For purposes of most bankruptcy proceedings, property interests are created and defined by state law. Once that state law determination is made, however, we must still look to federal bankruptcy law to resolve the extent to which that interest is property of the estate” under § 541. Parks v. FIA Card Servs., N.A., 550 F.3d 1251, 1255 (10th Cir.2008) (citations and quotations omitted); 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). We first consider whether and to what extent Debtors have an interest in the SARs under Kansas law. Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979); see, e.g., Williamson v. Hall, No. KS-08-088, 2009 WL 4456542, at *8 (10th Cir. BAP Dec. 4, 2009) (<HOLDING>). We then consider whether that interest",holding that pay on death accounts were not part of the bankruptcy estate under  541 because under kansas law debtor had no property interest in the accounts until the death of the owner,"We first consider whether and to what extent the Debtors have an interest in the SARs under Kansas law. The Debtors argue that they have an interest in the SARs under Kansas law, and that this interest is property of the estate under § 541(a)(1). The Trustee argues that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under Kansas law. The Trustee also argues that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is not an interest in property under § 541(a)(1).\n\nThe Debtors have not provided any Kansas cases or statutes that support their argument that they have an interest in the SARs under Kansas law. The Debtors have cited only two Kansas cases in support of their argument. See In re Higbee, 300 B.R. 850, 853-54 (Bankr.D.Kan.2003) (<HOLDING>); In re Higbee, 299 B.R. 719, 722-23 (Bankr.D.Kan.2003)\n(<HOLDING>). But these cases do not provide any support for\nthe Debtors’ position.\n\nIn Higbee, the bankruptcy court held that the debtor had an interest in the SARs under Kansas law. See 300 B.R. at 853-54. But the court did not hold that the debtor’s interest in the SARs was a property interest under § 541(a)(1). Id. at 854. Instead, the court held that the debtor’s interest in the SARs was a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under § 541(a)(1). Id. at 854-55.\n\nIn Higbee, the debtor was a stockbroker who had sold the SARs to a customer. See 300 B.R. at 852. The debtor had no right to receive the SARs until the customer exercised the SARs. See id. The bankruptcy court held that the debtor’s interest in the SARs was a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under § 541(a)(1). Id. at 854-55. The court noted that the debtor had no right to receive the SARs until the customer exercised them. See id. at 855. The court also noted that the debtor’s interest in the SARs was not a property interest because the debtor had no right to receive the SARs until the customer exercised them. See id.\n\nThe Trustee argues that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under § 541(a)(1). The Trustee points to the fact that the Debtors have no right to receive the SARs until the customer exercises them. See In re Higbee, 299 B.R. at 722 (<HOLDING>). The Trustee also points out that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is not a property interest because the Debtors have no right to receive the SARs until the customer exercises them. See id.\n\nWe agree with the Trustee that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under § 541(a)(1). See In re Higbee, 299 B.R. at 722 (<HOLDING>); see also In re Cox, 2009 WL 3890058, at *11 (Bankr.D.Kan. Nov. 16, 2009) (<HOLDING>); In re Higbee, 299 B.R. at 722 (<HOLDING>).\n\nWe also agree with the Trustee that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is not an interest in property under § 541(a)(1).

Nov. 16, 2009) (<HOLDING>).\n\nWe conclude that the Debtors’ interest in the SARs is a mere expectancy, and therefore not a property interest under § 541(a)(1). See In re Higbee, 299 B.R. at 722-23 (<HOLDING>); see also In re Cox, 2009 WL 3890058, at *11 (Bankr.D.Kan. Nov. 16, 2009) (<HOLDING>).
