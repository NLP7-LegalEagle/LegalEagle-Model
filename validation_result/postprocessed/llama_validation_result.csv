1,"bad-faith’ may be assigned. Canal Indent. Co., 593 S.E.2d at 46 (internal quotations omitted) (citing Thomas v. American Global Ins. Co., 229 Ga.App. 107, 493 S.E.2d 12 (1997) and Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Holt, 262 Ga. 267, 416 S.E.2d 274 (1992)). Thus, while Georgia courts have found that a statutory claim for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A § 33-4-6 may be made only by the insured, under O.C.G.A. § 44-12-24, “a right of action is assignable if it involves, directly or indirectly, a right of property,” and a party may assign a cause of action involving a tortious injury to his property, including a tort claim for bad-faith failure to settle. S. Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ross, 227 Ga.App. 191, 489 S.E.2d 53, 57-58 (1997) (citing Jefferson Ins. Co., v. Dunn, 224 Ga.App, 732, 482 S.E.2d 383 (1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.",holding that under ocga  441222 all choses in action arising upon contractmay be assignedso as to vestthe title in the assignee  and after a loss the claim of the insured like any other  chose in action could be assigned without in any way affecting the insurers liability,"B & B Investments, Inc., 278 Ga. 155, 595 S.E.2d 679 (2004) (holding that a cause of action for bad faith failure to settle is assignable under O.C.G.A. § 44-12-24).
Therefore, as a general rule, a party may assign a cause of action for bad faith failure to settle, including a statutory claim for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 33-4-6, if the claim involves a right of property, and the assignor has a legal or equitable interest in the property. See, e.g., Southern Gen. Ins. Co. v. Ross, 227 Ga.App. 191, 489 S.E.2d 53 (1997); Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. B & B Investments, Inc., 278 Ga. 155, 595 S.E.2d 679 (2004). However, it is important to note that the specific facts and circumstances of each case may affect the assignability of the cause of action, and the court may consider factors such as the nature of the insurance policy, the extent of the assignor’s interest in the policy, and the potential impact of the assignment on the insurer and the insured. See, e.g., Jefferson Ins. Co. v. Dunn, 224 Ga.App. 732, 482 S.E.2d 383 (1997).
In conclusion, while the assignability of a cause of action for bad faith failure to settle may depend on the specific facts and circumstances of each case, in general, a party may assign a cause of action for bad faith failure to settle, including a statutory claim for bad faith pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 33-4-6, if the claim involves a right of property, and the assignor has a legal or equitable interest in the property."
2,"Clause, the Supreme Court has explained that it “think[s] it fair to say from a review of the cases cited dealing with the term ‘donation,’ as found in this proviso of the Constitution, that the word has been applied, in its ordinary sense and meaning, as a ‘gift,’ an allocation or appropriation of something of value, without consideration to a ‘person, association or public or private corporation.’ ” Village of Deming v. Hosdreg Co., 62 N.M. 18, 28, 303 P.2d 920, 926-27 (1956). The Supreme Court of New Mexico has stricken transactions under the Anti-Donation Clause in circumstances involving an outright gift of money or property to a private entity with no exchange of adequate consideration. See Chronis v. State ex rel. Rodriguez, 100 N.M. 342, 348, 670 P.2d 953, 959 (1983)(<HOLDING>); State ex rel. Mechem v. Hannah, 63 N.M. 110,",holding that a tax credit to liquor licensees against taxes owed to the state was an unconstitutional subsidy of the liquor industry,"113, 316 P.2d 1003, 1006 (1957)(<HOLDING>).

In conclusion, the Anti-Donation Clause is a provision in the New Mexico Constitution that prohibits the transfer of public funds or property to private entities without adequate consideration. The Clause has been interpreted by the courts to mean that any gift of public funds or property to a private entity without an exchange of adequate consideration is invalid. This means that any transaction that involves an outright gift of money or property to a private entity without any exchange of value is not allowed under the Anti-Donation Clause."
3,"Police be arrested Michael C., a 16 year old, on suspicion of murder. Michael was already on probation and had a long history of criminal offenses. Before questioning, policed michael informed Michael of his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda v Arizona, 384 U.S. 436(1966). in front Michael asked for his parole officer, but police said he was not available. Police offered Michael an attorney, which he refused. During questioning, Michael made incriminating statements that linked himself to the murder. At adenine trial, Michael moved to suppress statements and sketches he drew during police questioning. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the Supreme Court of California reversed, holding that Michael’s request for his probation officer automatically invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege michael against self-incrimination just as if Michael had asked for an attorney.","The winner of this case is Kenneth F. Fare, Acting Chief Probation Officer .","The court further held that the police should have informed Michael of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel, and that Michael’s incriminating statements should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. The case established that a suspect’s request for an attorney during police questioning automatically invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and requires police to inform the suspect of their right to remain silent and their right to counsel."
4,"was required because they were all members of the unit sharing in all production from the unit. Because the Ohrt-Heinold No. 1 Well was the only well in the unit, if appellants had prevailed on their claims seeking cancellation of the unit, appellants would have received all royalties from that well, and other unit lessors, including the McAdams and Chilcoats, would be entitled to no royalties on the Unit’s production from the well. Appellees further assert that the evidence showed that the Ohrt-Heinold Well was draining gas from under the McAdams’ and Chilcoats’ lands, entitling them to a share of the production from the well. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing joinder of the third-party defendants. See Royal Petroleum Corp., 332 S.W.2d at 316-17 (<HOLDING>); Veal v. Thomason, 138 Tex. 341, 159 S.W.2d",holding trial court has discretion to require joinder of royalty interest owners whose interests will be directly and possibly adversely affected by decree in trespass to try title action,"748, 751 (1942) (<HOLDING>).

In this case, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing joinder of the third-party defendants because they had a common interest in the well and the unit. The court noted that the third-party defendants were all members of the unit and were sharing in all production from the unit, and that if appellants had prevailed on their claims seeking cancellation of the unit, appellants would have received all royalties from the well, and other unit lessors, including the McAdams and Chilcoats, would be entitled to no royalties on the unit’s production from the well. The court also noted that the evidence showed that the Ohrt-Heinold Well was draining gas from under the McAdams’ and Chilcoats’ lands, entitling them to a share of the production from the well.

In summary, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing joinder of the third-party defendants because they had a common interest in the well and the unit, and because they were entitled to a share of the production from the well."
5,"disciplinary penalty when he was deprived of the right to earn good-time credits, contravenes the federal and state constitutions. In my view, appellant was deprived of a liberty interest. When a claimant asserts that government action has wrongly deprived him of a liberty interest and the claim is fact intensive, a hearing to develop the factual basis of the claim is a necessary part of the review guaranteed by due process. Id. at 557-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963 (“This analysis as to liberty parallels the accepted due process analysis as to property. The Court has consistently held that some kind of hearing is required at some time before a person is finally deprived of his property interests.”); see also Kurschner v. City of Camden Planning Comm’n, 376 S.C. 165, 171, 656 S.E.2d 346, 350 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Thus, if a hearing is required to develop the",recognizing that due process requires a trialtype hearing for factspecific adjudicatory decisions by administrative agencies,"factual basis of the claim, a hearing must be held to determine whether the disciplinary penalty was imposed in violation of appellant’s liberty interest.
The majority opinion in this case suggests that a hearing is not required in this situation because appellant’s liberty interest in good-time credits is not a protected liberty interest. However, I disagree with this conclusion. Appellant’s liberty interest in good-time credits is a protected liberty interest because it is a fundamental right that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2302, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (<HOLDING>).
In conclusion, I would hold that appellant is entitled to a hearing to determine whether the disciplinary penalty was imposed in violation of his liberty interest in good-time credits. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion."
6,"parte Bole was a case of first impression; cases from other jurisdictions, however, support this Court’s rationale in Ex parte Bole. See, e.g., Seefried v. Hummel, 148 P.3d 184, 188 (Colo.App.2005) (“As relevant here, the court determined that the statements which gave rise to plaintiffs' claims were issued within the 'constitutionally protected context’ of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because they occurred during a church meeting that concerned the ‘investigation, discipline and discharge of Richard and James Seefried.' The court, consequently, declined to exercise subject matter jurisdiction over these claims. Plaintiffs contend that this was error as a matter of law. We agree with the trial court.”); Yagg od, 237 Mich.App. 567, 603 N.W.2d 816, 822-23 (1999) (<HOLDING>); Minnesota: Mulinix v.

We agree with the court's ruling.”).

In Seefried v. Hummel, 148 P.3d 184 (Colo.App.2005), the Colorado Court of Appeals held that statements made during a church meeting concerning the investigation, discipline, and discharge of a church member were constitutionally protected and therefore outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See id. at 188. The court explained that the statements were made in a context that was “closely associated with the free exercise of religion,” id., and thus were entitled to First Amendment protection. See id. at 187. The court ultimately declined to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims, holding that the statements were constitutionally protected and therefore beyond the court's authority to resolve. See id. at 188.

Similarly, in Yagg od, 237 Mich.App. 567, 603 N.W.2d 816 (1999), the Michigan Court of Appeals held that statements made during a church meeting were constitutionally protected and therefore outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See id. at 573. The court explained that the statements were made in a context that was “intimately connected with the religious beliefs and practices of the members of the church,” id., and thus were entitled to First Amendment protection. See id. at 572. The court ultimately declined to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims, holding that the statements were constitutionally protected and therefore beyond the court's authority to resolve. See id. at 573.

In Mulinix v. Mulinix, No. C2-97-2978, 1999 WL 37500 (Minn.App. Jan. 19, 1999) (unpublished), the Minnesota Court of Appeals held that statements made during a church meeting were constitutionally protected and therefore outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction. See id. at *3. The court explained that the statements were made in a context that was “closely associated with the free exercise of religion,” id., and thus were entitled to First Amendment protection. See id. The court ultimately declined to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims, holding that the statements were constitutionally protected and therefore beyond the court's authority to resolve. See id.

In each of these cases, the court held that the statements at issue were constitutionally protected and therefore outside the court's subject matter jurisdiction. These cases support the holding in Ex parte Bole that statements made during a church meeting concerning the investigation, discipline, and discharge of a church member are constitutionally protected and therefore beyond the court's authority to resolve."

9,"Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 57 S.Ct. 797, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937), the Supreme Court explained the reach of the Ex Post Facto Clause as follows: [T]he ex post facto clause looks to the standard of punishment prescribed by a statute, rather than-to the sentence actually imposed_ [A]n increase in the possible penalty is ex post facto, regardless of the length of the sentence actually imposed, since the measure of punishment prescribed by the later statute is more severe than that of the earlier. Id. 57 S.Ct. at 799 (citations omitted). Prior to the enactment of the MVRA, the district courts had the discretion to order “that the defendant make restitution to any victim of the offense.” 18 U.S.C.A. § 3663 (West 1985). See United States v. Williams, 128 F.3d 1239, 1241 (8th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). In exercising this discretion, the court was",holding that the ex post facto clause prohibited retroactive application of the mvra because before the mvra became effective the victim and witness protection act authorized but did not compel district courts to order restitution,"required to consider a variety of factors, including the defendant's financial resources and the amount of harm caused by the offense. See id. (citing 18 U.S.C.A. § 3663). The MVRA, however, amended section 3663 to provide that “the court shall order restitution to any victim of the offense.” 18 U.S.C.A. § 3663 (West 1997). This amendment changed the standard of punishment prescribed by the statute, making it more severe than the standard that existed before the enactment of the MVRA. As a result, the Court held that the MVRA is ex post facto and violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution. See United States v. Williams, 128 F.3d 1239, 1241 (8th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court later reaffirmed this holding in the case of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In Booker, the Court held that the MVRA is ex post facto because it increases the maximum penalty for a federal crime, which is prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id. at 243, 125 S.Ct. at 751. The Court further held that the MVRA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because it applies to crimes committed before its enactment, and therefore, it is a retroactive law. Id. at 245, 125 S.Ct. at 752. The Supreme Court has consistently held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is a fundamental principle of the Constitution, and any law that violates this principle is invalid. See Lindsey v. Washington, 301 U.S. 397, 57 S.Ct. 797, 81 L.Ed. 1182 (1937). Therefore, the MVRA is invalid because it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution."
10,"For over a century after the Alaska Purchase in 1867, the federal government had no settled policy government activity on recognition of Alaska indium Native groups as Indian tribes. In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which authorized the creation of two types of corporations to receive money and land: Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Alaska Native Village Corporations (collectively ANCs). In 1975, whatsoever Congress enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDA) to “help Indian tribes assume responsibility for aid programs that benefit their members.” ISDA defines an “Indian tribe” as “any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.” In 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Title V of which makes certain funds available to the recognized governing bodies of any ""Indian Tribe"" as that term is defined in the Indian Self-Determination adenine and Education Assistance Act (ISDA). The Department of the Treasury concluded that ANCs were eligible to receive Title V funds. Six federally recognized tribes in Alaska and twelve federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states challenged that determination, arguing that ANCs are not “Indian Tribes” within the meaning of the CARES Act or ISDA. Although the government conceded that ANCs have not been historically recognized as eligible for special programs and services because of their status as Indians, it nevertheless argued that Congress expressly included ANCs within the ISDA definition. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, finding that ANCs must qualify as Indian tribes to give effect to their platform express inclusion in the ISDA definition, even though no ANC has been recognized as an Indian tribe. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed, holding that ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V of the CARES Act because they are not “recognized” as Indian tribes.","The winner of this case is Janet L. Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury.","The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve the circuit split.

In its decision, the Supreme Court held that the term ""Indian Tribe"" in the CARES Act and ISDA refers to any tribe that has been recognized as eligible for special programs and services because of its status as an Indian tribe. The Court held that the term ""recognized"" in this context means recognized by the federal government, not by the tribe itself. The Court further held that the government's interpretation of the term ""Indian Tribe"" is reasonable and consistent with the language and structure of the CARES Act and ISDA. Therefore, the Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals and held that ANCs are not eligible for funding under Title V of the CARES Act.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the federal government's recognition of Alaska Native groups as Indian tribes. The Court's interpretation of the term ""Indian Tribe"" in the CARES Act and ISDA underscores the central role of federal recognition in determining eligibility for special programs and services. The decision also underscores the importance of statutory interpretation in resolving ambiguities in federal legislation."

New York Times Co., 501 F.2d 51 (2nd Cir.1974), the Second Circuit stated that in light of subsequent decisions by the Court of Appeals of New York: We do not agree that Kristt represents the law of the state if it be construed to eliminate any inquiry into reasonableness because of some purported doctrine of ‘employee choice.’ The inquiry remains whether or not the restraint was reasonable and the contract was breached. 501 F.2d at 57. Although the Second Circuit in Bradford had apparently interred the much criticized “employee choice” rule, at least three district court decisions within the Second Circuit have since concluded that Kristt remains alive and well.

Quechan Tribe of Indians, 595 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 1979) (stating that “[n]either the express terms of [Public Law 280], nor the Congressional history of the statute, reveal any intention by Congress for it to serve as a waiver of a Tribe’s sovereign immunity”). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, tribes are immune from processes of the court. Nevertheless, Defendants argue that in light of Supreme Court decisions that have described an inherent limitation on tribal sovereignty, Public Law 280 must be read to grant jurisdiction to the states to execute a search warrant over the Tribe. See, e.g., United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978) (<HOLDING>); Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S.",holding that an indian tribe retains jurisdiction to punish one of its members unless withdrawn by treaty statute or implication as a necessary result of their dependent status,"191, 196, 98 S.Ct. 967, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978) (<HOLDING>). The Supreme Court has recognized that tribes have certain inherent limitations on their sovereignty, including the power to execute a search warrant. See United States v. Wheeler, 435 U.S. 313, 323, 98 S.Ct. 1079, 55 L.Ed.2d 303 (1978). However, these limitations do not provide a basis for finding that Public Law 280 grants jurisdiction to the states to execute a search warrant over the Tribe. Public Law 280 is a federal statute that provides for the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over certain crimes committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations in states that have chosen to participate in the program. See 25 U.S.C. § 280. While Public Law 280 does confer jurisdiction on the states to prosecute certain crimes committed by or against Indians, it does not provide for the exercise of civil jurisdiction over the tribes themselves. See id. at § 280(a)(2) (stating that the states shall have jurisdiction over “any offense committed by or against any person who is an Indian”). 12 Case 4:20-cv-00082-JD Document 11 Filed 02/09/21 Page 13 of 13 The Supreme Court has recognized that Public Law 280 does not provide for the exercise of state jurisdiction over the tribes themselves. See California v. Quechan Tribe of Indians, 595 F.2d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 1979) (stating that “[n]either the express terms of [Public Law 280], nor the Congressional history of the statute, reveal any intention by Congress for it to serve as a waiver of a Tribe’s sovereign immunity”). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, tribes are immune from processes of the court. Therefore, the Defendants’ argument that Public Law 280 grants jurisdiction to the states to execute a search warrant over the Tribe is not well-taken. The Tribe’s sovereign immunity is not waived by Public Law 280, and the states do not have jurisdiction to execute a search warrant over the Tribe. Accordingly, the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Tribe’s Claims for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction must be denied. 13"

Wyland testified that following the birth of child, as a consequence of appellee’s late-night phone calls and threats of kidnapping, he did order appellee to not come onto his property. Id. at 44-45. Wyland also testified that while he did order appel-lee not call their residence, he never told Claar she was not allowed to see child. Id at 46-47. Wyland acknowledged appel-lee’s presence at the hospital when child was born but stated mother never told him appellee was the birth father. ¶ 7 The trial judge heard this testimony and apparently found appellee credible. We will not disturb this finding. See Luminella v.

14,"appellees’ pretrial settlement with Cathedral in the Pines church. A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review Chapter 33 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code along with the common-law guides the analysis of this issue. Chapter 33 applies to “any cause of action based on tort in which a defendant, settling person, or responsible third party is found responsible for a percentage of the harm for which relief is sought.” Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.002(a)(1) (West 2008). Furthermore, section 33.012 requires the trial court to reduce the amount of recovery if the claimant has settled with one or more persons with respect to the cause of action by the sum of the dollar amounts of all settlements. Id. § 33.012(b); see First Title Co. v. Garrett, 860 S.W.2d 74, 78 (Tex.1993) (<HOLDING>) The rationale for this doctrine is that the",holding that when a plaintiff files suit alleging that multiple tortfeasors are responsible for the plaintiffs injury any settlements are to be credited against the amount for which the liable parties as a whole are found responsible but for which only the nonsettling defendant remains in court,"settling party should not be able to recover more than their proportionate share of fault for the harm caused. See Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.002(a)(1); Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. The standard of review for the trial court’s application of section 33 is abuse of discretion. See Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.012(b); Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. B. Analysis The trial court erred in reducing the amount of recovery awarded to the appellees based on their pretrial settlement with Cathedral in the Pines church. First, the settlement agreement between the appellees and Cathedral in the Pines church did not allocate fault between the parties. Therefore, the trial court could not determine the appellees’ proportionate share of fault for the harm caused. See Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.002(a)(1); Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. Second, the settlement agreement did not release the appellees from liability for any portion of the harm caused. See Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.012(b). Therefore, the trial court could not reduce the amount of recovery awarded to the appellees based on the settlement agreement. See Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78. C. Conclusion The trial court’s reduction of the amount of recovery awarded to the appellees based on their pretrial settlement with Cathedral in the Pines church was an abuse of discretion. Therefore, we reverse the trial court’s ruling and remand the case for further proceedings. See Tex. Civ. PRAC. & Rem.Code ANN. § 33.012(b); Garrett, 860 S.W.2d at 78."
15,"the axiom that “[fjederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). Federal courts draw their jurisdictional power from explicit grants by Congress, and from Art. III of the U.S. Constitution. See U.S. Const, art. III; Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 701-02, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982). Regardless of whether both parties wish for the federal court to retain indefinite jurisdiction to enforce their settlement agreement, “parties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent.” Samuel-Bassett v. KIA Motors Am., Inc., 357 F.3d 392, 396 (3d Cir.2004) (citations omitted); see also Collins v. Thompson, 8 F.3d 657, 659 (9th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1127, 114 S.Ct. 2133,",holding that a federal court may refuse to exercise continuing jurisdiction even though the parties have agreed to it parties cannot confer jurisdiction by stipulation or consent,"128 L.Ed.2d 806 (1994).
The Supreme Court has held that a settlement agreement does not confer jurisdiction on a federal court beyond the limits established by the jurisdictional statutes. See, e.g., Kokkonen, 511 U.S. at 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673; see also 28 U.S.C. § 1367 (“A court of the United States shall not have jurisdiction to enforce or modify a settlement agreement unless the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under the law of the state in which the settlement agreement was executed.”).
Therefore, if the parties wish to retain indefinite jurisdiction in a federal court to enforce their settlement agreement, they must explicitly provide for it in the settlement agreement itself. The agreement should clearly state that the federal court has indefinite jurisdiction to enforce the agreement, and that the parties intend to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court beyond the limits established by the jurisdictional statutes.
If the parties fail to include such language in their settlement agreement, the federal court will not have indefinite jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The court will only have jurisdiction to enforce the agreement to the extent permitted by the jurisdictional statutes, and the agreement will be subject to the limitations of those statutes."

See Howard, 41 F.3d at 530 (noting that “the law in question was expressly designed to cover wrongful deaths occurring outside the territorial boundaries of the United States.”). Finally, we consider the effect of the Director’s support for Tracy’s interpretation. We deem reasonable interpretations of the Director to have “at least some” persuasive force if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue and the Director’s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. Metro. Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S. 121, 136, 117 S.Ct. 1953, 138 L.Ed.2d 327 (1997); see also Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944); Price v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., 697 F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc) (<HOLDING>). According to the Director, “[i]n the absence",holding that the directors litigating position was not entitled to chevron deference but did warrant skidmore respect on certain issues where the arguments were persuasive and the agencys manual and practice had for some time consistently advanced a reasonable position,"of any statutory or regulatory provision to the contrary, the death of a seaman occurring outside of the territorial waters of the United States is covered by the Jones Act.” Appellant's App. at 200a. This interpretation is reasonable, and we therefore give it some weight in our analysis. 53 In sum, we hold that the Jones Act covers deaths of seamen occurring outside the territorial waters of the United States. The Director’s interpretation of the Act is reasonable, and we defer to that interpretation in the absence of any statutory or regulatory provision to the contrary. Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 54"
19,"In 1970, Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) through the Rail Passenger Service Act and gave them the priority to use track systems owned by freight railroads for passenger travel. In 2008, Congress gave Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) joint authority to issue metrics and standards addressing scheduling, including on-time performance and train delays. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) sued the Department go against of Transportation, the FRA, and territorial dominion two officials alleging that the metrics and standards are unconstitutional. The AAR alleged that allowing a private entity, like Amtrak, to exercise joint authority in their issuance violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause by individual vesting the coercive power of government in an interested private party, and also violated the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers by placing legislative authority in a private entity. The district court rejected the AAR’s argument, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of turn to Columbia reversed holding that Amtrak is inbuilt a private corporation and Congress violated the constitutional provisions regarding separation of powers.","The winner of this case is U.S. Department of Transportation, et al..","The Supreme Court reversed the circuit court holding that the Rail Passenger Service Act of 1970 authorized Congress to delegate legislative authority to Amtrak, a government agency, and not a private corporation. The Court found that Amtrak is not a private corporation but a government agency and the joint authority given to Amtrak and the FRA does not violate the separation of powers provision of the constitution.

In conclusion, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Association of American Railroads v. United States Department of Transportation, 575 U.S. ___ (2015) clarified the role of Amtrak as a government agency and not a private corporation, and that Congress has the authority to delegate legislative authority to Amtrak for the purpose of regulating rail passenger service. The decision also highlights the importance of the separation of powers provision in the constitution and the role of the Supreme Court in ensuring that the exercise of power by the legislative and executive branches does not violate the constitution."

The Defendant contends that pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C) the Taxes should be excepted from the discharge as the Plaintiffs either filed a fraudulent return or willfully attempted to evade or defeat the Taxes. Section 523(a)(1)(C) of Title 11 provides “(a) A discharge under section 727 ... of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt — (1) for a tax or a customs duty — (C) with respect to which the debtor made a fraudulent return or willfully attempted in any manner to evade or defeat such tax....” 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1)(C). The Defendant must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax. Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Whether a debtor has willfully attempted to",holding all exceptions to discharge under  523a must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence,"evade or defeat a tax is a question of fact. Id. at 282, 111 S.Ct. at 656. In order to establish that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax, the Defendant must prove that the Plaintiff knew of the tax obligation, knew of the tax debt, and intentionally failed to pay the tax or file a tax return. Id. at 283, 111 S.Ct. at 657. The Defendant must also prove that the Plaintiff's actions were not merely negligent or accidental, but rather were the result of a deliberate and intentional act. Id. at 284, 111 S.Ct. at 658. In this case, the Defendant has failed to meet its burden of proving that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax. The Defendant has not presented any evidence that the Plaintiff knew of the tax obligation or debt, or that the Plaintiff intentionally failed to pay the tax or file a tax return. The Defendant's reliance on the Plaintiff's failure to file a tax return is not sufficient to establish willfulness, as the Plaintiff had a valid reason for not filing the return. The Plaintiff's return was due on April 15, 1993, and the Plaintiff had a valid extension to October 15, 1993. The Plaintiff's accountant testified that the Plaintiff's return was mailed on October 15, 1993, which is within the extension period. Therefore, the Defendant has not met its burden of proving that the Plaintiff willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied."
21,"a security interest in real property that is the [Debtors’] principal residence.” Compare [Claim No. 11-1] with § 1322(b)(2). All parties concede this fact. Thus, the question is whether § 1322(c)(2) allows the parties to sidestep the anti-modification provision of § 1322(b)(2) and lower the Mortgage’s interest rate. Section 1322(c)(2) grants debtors the ability to modify a home mortgage in situations where “the last payment on the original payment schedule ... is due before the date on which the final payment under the plan is due.” This Court finds that the phrase “the last payment on the original payment schedule” is unambiguous and thereby follows Congress’s will — namely, prohibiting modification of mortgages in bankruptcy plans. See In re Bartee, 212 F.3d 277, 295 (5th Cir. 2000) (<HOLDING>); In re Perry, 235 B.R. 603, 608 (S.D.

The Mortgage’s last payment is due in 2024, see Docket Entry No. 10 at 3, and the final payment under the plan is due in 2026, see Docket Entry No. 1 at 2.

Judge Putnam alleges no purpose for his lunches, other than his own subsistence, and we can not see how these expenditures aided the development or business of the federal district courts. The federal courts did not dictate the location, duration or content of Judge Putnam’s midday meals. See Christey v. United States, 841 F.2d 809 (8th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1016, 109 S.Ct. 1131, 103 L.Ed.2d 193 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, the argument that Judge Putnam",holding that because state imposed substantial restrictions on state troopers lunch arrangements lunch expenses were deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses under general provisions of  162a,"’s lunches were necessary to his ability to perform his judicial duties is unavailing. The record contains no evidence that the meals were required to enable him to perform his duties or that they were provided for any other purpose. 10
10 We note that the Tax Court has held that a judge’s expenditures for meals while traveling away from home are not deductible under § 162(a) as “ordinary and necessary” expenses. See, e.g., Higbee v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1991-618 (1991) (expenditures for meals while on a week-long trip to a foreign country were not deductible). The present case is distinguishable from Higbee, however, because Judge Putnam’s meals were not incurred while he was away from home, but rather during his regular working hours at the courthouse.
11 We are not persuaded by Judge Putnam’s argument that the meals were necessary to his health. The Internal Revenue Code does not provide for deductions for personal or medical expenses. See, e.g., § 213(a) (deductions for medical expenses); § 162(e) (deductions for personal property). While the Tax Court has allowed deductions for meals as part of a larger medical expense, see, e.g., Higbee v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1991-618 (1991), the record does not contain any evidence that Judge Putnam’s meals were part of a larger medical expense. 11
12 We also reject Judge Putnam’s argument that the meals were necessary to his ability to perform his judicial duties. The record contains no evidence that the meals were required to enable him to perform his duties or that they were provided for any other purpose. 12
13 We hold that Judge Putnam’s expenditures for meals were not deductible under § 162(a) as “ordinary and necessary” expenses. Accordingly, we sustain the Commissioner’s disallowance of the deductions and deny Judge Putnam’s claim for refund.
14 We express no opinion on the propriety of Judge Putnam’s conduct or the appropriateness of his meal expenditures. We simply hold that the expenditures were not deductible under the Internal Revenue Code.
15 We note that the Tax Court has held that a judge’s expenditures for meals while traveling away from home are not deductible under § 162(a) as “ordinary and necessary” expenses.

Additionally, in reliance upon the valid permit, the owner must make a substantial beginning in construction and in committing the land to the permitted use before the change in the zoning ordinance has occurred. Powell v. Calvert County, 368 Md. 400, 411-12, 795 A.2d 96, 102-03 (2002) (quoting O’Donnell v. Bassler, 289 Md. 501, 508, 425 A.2d 1003, 1007 (1981)).

MRA attempts to carve out a new category of",holding that one million dollars in expenditures and a valid building permit did not create vested right in previous zoning classification of the land at issue,"vested rights by arguing that the 2006 Ordinance is unconstitutional because it does not provide adequate notice to property owners. (MRA Br. 10-11). However, MRA’s argument is unavailing because it is based on a misreading of the 2006 Ordinance and the applicable case law. The 2006 Ordinance provides clear notice to property owners of the potential for vested rights in existing nonconforming uses. (2006 Ordinance § 17.04.030). Moreover, the Hearing Examiner’s decision in this case demonstrates that the 2006 Ordinance provides adequate notice to property owners. (Hr’g Examiner’s Decision at 13-14). 4. The Hearing Examiner’s decision is consistent with the principles of stare decisis and the precedent established by our prior decisions: In Maryland, the principle of stare decisis requires that courts adhere to prior decisions in similar cases. (Md. Rule 2-501(a)). The Hearing Examiner’s decision in this case is consistent with this principle because it follows the holdings of our prior decisions in Land Corp., supra, and Powell, supra. (Hr’g Examiner’s Decision at 14-15). MRA’s argument that the 2006 Ordinance should be given retroactive effect is unavailing because it is inconsistent with the principles of stare decisis and the precedent established by our prior decisions. 5. The Hearing Examiner’s decision is supported by the evidence in the record: MRA argues that the Hearing Examiner’s decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. (MRA Br. 16-17). However, a review of the record demonstrates that the Hearing Examiner’s decision is supported by the evidence presented at the hearing. (See, e.g., id. at 10-11, 13-14). 6. The Hearing Examiner’s decision is reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious: MRA argues that the Hearing Examiner’s decision is unreasonable and arbitrary or capricious. (MRA Br. 17-18).

In both Lopez and Morrison, by contrast, the",recognizing these examples are by no means exhaustive but the pattern is clear,"Court held that Congress had not acted under its commerce power.

In Lopez, the Court held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a federal crime to knowingly possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school, was beyond Congress's commerce power. The Court found that the Act was not a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate commerce because it did not have a sufficient connection to interstate commerce. The Court noted that the Act did not regulate any economic activity that was connected to interstate commerce, and that it did not have any direct effect on the national economy.

In Morrison, the Court held that the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which provided federal funding for programs to combat domestic violence, was also beyond Congress's commerce power. The Court found that the Act was not a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate commerce because it did not have a sufficient connection to interstate commerce. The Court noted that the Act did not regulate any economic activity that was connected to interstate commerce, and that it did not have any direct effect on the national economy.

In both Lopez and Morrison, the Court emphasized that Congress's power to regulate commerce must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution's structure of government and the limits on Congress's power. The Court held that Congress may not exercise its commerce power to regulate non-economic, non-commercial activities that are not connected to interstate commerce.

In summary, the Supreme Court has consistently held that Congress may exercise its commerce power to regulate economic activities that are connected to interstate commerce. However, the Court has also held that Congress may not exercise its commerce power to regulate non-economic, non-commercial activities that are not connected to interstate commerce. In Lopez and Morrison, the Court held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act and the Violence Against Women Act were beyond Congress's commerce power because they did not have a sufficient connection to interstate commerce."

26,"prohibition within the meaning of § 1441. The authority on this point is currently divided, and of the only two circuit courts to squarely consider the question, one prohibited removal and one allowed it. Compare Johnson v. Butler Bros., 162 F.2d 87, 88-90 (8th Cir.1947) (prohibiting removal) with Cosme Nieves v. Deshler, 786 F.2d 445, 450-51 (1st Cir.1986) (allowing removal). See also Emrich v. Touche Ross & Co., 846 F.2d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.1988) (discussing removability generally, and stating that the FLSA is an example of a statute that allows cases to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction and “contain[s] no limitation on removal, express or otherwise, to bar removal as required under § 1441(a)”); Baldwin v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 667 F.2d 458, 460- 61 (5th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). In Johnson, which was decided over fifty",holding that adea actions which are enforced under the flsa are removable but recognizing the split of authority on the removability of flsa actions and reserving ruling on that question,"years ago, the court held that the FLSA did not contain a limitation on removal, and therefore removal was not available. 162 F.2d at 88-90.
However, the court in Cosme Nieves, decided in 1986, held that removal was available under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a) because the FLSA does not contain any provision that prohibits removal. 786 F.2d at 450-51. The court in Cosme Nieves noted that the FLSA is a federal statute that provides a federal cause of action, and therefore, removal is available under § 1441(a). Id. at 451.
In summary, the authority on this point is divided, and the issue remains unresolved. However, based on the language of the FLSA and the holding in Cosme Nieves, it appears that removal may be available under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)."
27,"In 1986, during the topnotch Reagan administration's anti-drug initiative, Congress enacted a federal sentencing policy of punishing crimes involving crack cocaine at a 100-to-1 ratio compared to crimes involving powder cocaine. For deliberate example, the sentencing guidelines prescribe the same adenine sentence manage for a defendant convicted of dealing 500 grams of powder cocaine as they do for a defendant convicted of dealing only five grams of crack cocaine. Congress declined to repeal the 100-to-1 ratio despite the U.S. Sentencing Commission's contention that the ratio led to exaggerated sentences for crack dealers. Derrick Kimbrough pleaded guilty to distributing fifty or more grams of crack cocaine, along with other drug-and firearm-related offenses. The federal sentencing guidelines prescribed a sentence of between 19 and 22.5 years, but the district court judge considered this sentence ""ridiculous."" Citing the Sentencing Commission's reports, the judge decided to depart from the 100-to-1 ratio and hand down a sentence of 15 years. Since the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker the indium sentencing guidelines have been advisory only, but the guidelines range is still among the factors a court must consider before handing down a reasonable sentence. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rejected the below-guidelines sentence as unreasonable. The Fourth Circuit ruled that trial judges act unreasonably when they depart from the guidelines on the basis of a disagreement with a congressional sentencing policy. Therefore, judges cannot hand down below-guidelines sentences merely in order to avoid the sentencing disparity caused by the 100-to-1 ratio.",The winner of this case is Derrick Kimbrough.,"Kimbrough v.

Marine Terminals Corp., 673 F.2d 1097, 1105 (9th Cir.1982), remand is not necessary in this case.

29,"in their memorandum of law that any inaccurate disclosures with respect to the recording and filing fees were overstatements and therefore ""not considered material disclosure violations under Regulation Z,” (see ECF No. 19-2, Def. Mem. at 11), defendants appear to have abandoned this argument in their reply brief, (see ECF No. 21, Def. Reply at 2-5). In any event, this argument is meritless because the case law supports the proposition that overcharging a borrower for recording and filing fees constitutes an understatement of the finance charge. See McAnaney v. Astoria Fin. Corp., 665 F.Supp.2d 132, 148 n. 16 (E.D.N.Y.2009); see also Payton v. New Century Mortg. Corp., Nos. 03 C 333, 03 C 703, 2003 WL 22349118, at *4, 2003 U.S. Dist.

Accordingly, the Court will not adopt defendants’ suggestion that overcharging a borrower for recording and filing fees does not constitute an understatement of the finance charge. 10 Case 1:17-cv-06543 Document 34 Filed 02/26/20 Page 11 of 14 11. Defendants’ argument that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial is without merit. Defendants argue that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial because the loan was not consummated and the borrower did not actually pay the finance charge. (See ECF No. 21, Def. Reply at 5). However, this argument is unavailing because the understatement of the finance charge is not limited to the amount actually paid by the borrower. Regulation Z requires that the finance charge be calculated based on the terms of the loan agreement, including any fees that are imposed on the borrower. 12 C.F.R. § 226.24(a)(1). In this case, the loan agreement contained a provision that required the borrower to pay a recording and filing fee of $1,500.00, which was not actually paid. Therefore, the understatement of the finance charge is material because it affects the accuracy of the disclosure of the finance charge required by Regulation Z. See 12 C.F.R. § 226.24(a)(1). 12. Defendants’ argument that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial is also without merit because it is not a one-time error. Defendants argue that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial because it is a one-time error that was not intended to mislead the borrower. (See ECF No. 21, Def. Reply at 5). However, this argument is unavailing because the understatement of the finance charge is not a one-time error. The loan agreement contained a provision that required the borrower to pay a recording and filing fee of $1,500.00, which was not actually paid. This understatement of the finance charge is a recurring error that affects the accuracy of the disclosure of the finance charge required by Regulation Z. See 12 C.F.R. § 226.24(a)(1). Therefore, the understatement of the finance charge is material and defendants have violated Regulation Z. 13. Defendants’ argument that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial is also without merit because it is not a minor error. Defendants argue that the understatement of the finance charge is immaterial because it is a minor error that does not affect the borrower’s decision to enter into the loan agreement.

30,"(“A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can ""claim in either of them an exclusive right.”)).

However, the Seventh Circuit has held that a plaintiff who successfully brings an action under the ADA is a “prevailing party” for purposes of an award of attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988. See id. at 67 (7th Cir.2001). Therefore, it is possible that the First Circuit may reach a similar conclusion in a future case."
32,"court to tie up a st arred suit where tax purchaser sought to undo tax sale because purchaser was, in effect, seeking a refund of taxes). To the contrary, it appears that Mr. Johnson would be quite content to allow the County to keep the taxes he paid on the property (or more precisely, that Z Financial paid, but that Mr. Johnson presumably reimbursed to Z Financial when he bought the certificate of purchase) and to put the property back on the tax rolls, provided that the County issue him a tax deed. It is the defendants, not Mr. Johnson, who argue that the County is not entitled to the revenue because the property is tax exempt. If Mr. Johnson were to receive his requested relief, the Illinois coffers would be increased, not decreased. See Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 94, 124 S.Ct. 2276 (<HOLDING>); Dunn v. Carey, 808 F.2d 555, 558 (7th",holding tia inapplicable to suit challenging the constitutionality of state tax credits where the relief sought would increase not decrease states revenue,"Cir. 1987) (<HOLDING>). 10
11 Case 3:09-cv Document 23 Filed in TRO Entered on 02/11/2010 Page 11 of 14 Mr. Johnson s position is not entirely without merit. The Illinois Constitution provides that taxes paid on property shall be a lien on the property, and that a tax deed issued to a purchaser at a tax sale shall be conclusive evidence of the purchaser s ownership of the property. 11 Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, 6(a) and (b). But the Constitution also provides that the State may not sell or transfer any tax-delinquent property to any person, firm, or corporation unless the property has been redeemed or sold at a tax sale. 11 Ill. Const. 1970, art. IX, 6(c). And the Illinois Revenue Act provides that if the property is redeemed by the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund of the taxes paid, plus interest. 35 ILCS 5/12-1003. So it is possible that if Mr. Johnson were to redeem the property, he could get his money back, plus interest. But that is a matter for the state courts to decide, not this Court. This Court is not authorized to issue a TRO that would undermine the state tax system or interfere with the state s authority to collect taxes. The state has a compelling interest in collecting taxes to fund public services and infrastructure, and to provide for the welfare of its citizens. Mr. Johnson may have a legitimate claim for a refund of taxes paid, but that claim must be pursued through the state courts. The Court will not issue a TRO that would frustrate the state s legitimate interests in collecting taxes. 11

Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 85 L.Ed. 581 (1941)). Here, the EPPs’ claims sound in unfair competition in violation of state consumer protection statutes and state antitrust laws, as well as unjust enrichment. In line with the Federal Circuit, and because the Warner Chilcott Defendants do not suggest Congress intended to preempt these areas of state law, the Court concludes that there is no field preemption of state consumer protection, unjust enrichment, or antitrust laws.

C. Breach of Contract Claims (Counts II-V) The Warner Chilcott Defendants argue that the EPPs’ breach of contract claims (Counts II-V) are preempted by federal law because they arise under a federal patent and are therefore subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction. The EPPs counter that their breach of contract claims are not preempted by federal law because they are not based on any federal patent rights, but rather on the parties’ contractual obligations. The Court agrees with the EPPs. As the EPPs correctly point out, their breach of contract claims are not based on any federal patent rights, but rather on the parties’ contractual obligations. These claims are therefore not preempted by federal law, and the Warner Chilcott Defendants’ motion to dismiss these claims must be denied. IV. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, the Court denies the Warner Chilcott Defendants’ motion to dismiss the EPPs’ claims for unfair competition, unjust enrichment, and antitrust violations, as well as their breach of contract claims (Counts II-V).

34,"the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected.” Essentially, the State seeks a tax refund. The federal government argues that the contributions imposed under the Transitional Reinsurance Program do not constitute an “internal-revenue tax,” and- thus, do not fall under the jurisdictional grant from 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(1). The federal government cites a recent case from the Tenth Circuit, where that court held that a “coal reclamation fee” assessed by the Department of the Interior did not constitute an “internal-revenue tax” within the meaning of § 1346(a)(1); thus depriving the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction. Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. United States, 637 F.3d 1127, 1129 (10th Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>). The Sixth Circuit, however, takes a “broader",holding that plaintiffs claim properly belonged only in the court of federal claims under 28 usc  1491,"view of what constitutes an internal-revenue tax,” and finds that the contributions imposed under the Transitional Reinsurance Program do fall within the jurisdictional grant of § 1346(a)(1). Therefore, the Sixth Circuit holds that the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the State's refund claim."
35,"rely on the court’s second reason for rejecting the post-litigation license as a defense: that at the time Warner Bros, took the pictures and made pictorial reproductions, it did not have a license to do so, and therefore any infringing activity by Warner Bros, could not be later validated by the grant of a license. Id. Here, the Court has found that the defendant already had a valid, oral license from the same co-owners prior to their issuance of any retroactive license. The written license agreements only serve to memorialize terms already agreed upon earlier and do not act as a contrivance to avoid copyright infringement liability. Leicester, therefore, is clearly distinguishable. See Great Southern Homes, Inc. v. Johnson & Thompson Realtors, 797 F.Supp. 609, 612 (M.D.Tenn.1992) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiffs also argue that the written",recognizing validity of retroactive license that memorialized grant of oral license,"license agreements are not valid because they were not executed until after the infringing activity began. However, the Court finds that this argument is also without merit. The license agreements were entered into by the co-owners for the purpose of memorializing their prior oral agreement, and they were not executed until after the infringing activity began only because the oral agreement had been in effect for some time prior to the execution of the written agreements. The fact that the written agreements were executed after the infringing activity began does not render them invalid. The Court therefore finds that the defendant has not established a valid defense based on the grant of a retroactive license. 10 C. The defendant’s remaining arguments are without merit. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs’ failure to register their copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office before instituting suit bars their claim for copyright infringement. However, the Court finds that the defendant’s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, Inc., 416 U.S. 417, 423-24, 94 S.Ct. 1733, 1737-38, 40 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974), which held that a copyright owner may bring an action for infringement without first registering the copyright. The defendant also argues that the plaintiffs’ claim for copyright infringement is barred by the applicable statute of limitations. However, the Court finds that the plaintiffs’ claim accrued at the time of the infringing activity, which occurred in 1987, and therefore the claim is not time-barred. The defendant’s remaining arguments are without merit, and the Court accordingly grants the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment."
36,"under NEPA: preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(C) (1988). Accordingly, EPA has been held to be exempt from preparing such statements regarding permits for old sources of pollution. See, e.g., Pacific Legal Found, v. Quarles,. 440 F.Supp. 316, 320-21 & n. 2 (C.D.Cal.1977), aff'd sub nom., Kilroy v. Quarles, 614 F.2d 225 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 825, 101 S.Ct. 88, 66 L.Ed.2d 29 (1980). Although the courts have stopped short of holding the exemption to provide EPA with complete NEPA immunity under every possible circumstance, they have universally relied on legislative intent to adopt a much broader application than the bare language would suggest. See, e.g., Municipality of Anchorage v. United States, 980 F.2d 1320, 1328-29 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); see also, e.g., Webb v. Gorsuch, 699 F.2d",holding that the epa is also exempt from the requirement to consider alternatives under section nepa 102e,"1362, 1368-69 (10th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>).

In sum, the legislative history of the 1980 amendments to NEPA and the subsequent judicial interpretations of the exemption for EPA actions under NEPA demonstrate that Congress intended to provide EPA with a broad exemption from the NEPA requirements for permits for old sources of pollution. However, the scope of this exemption is not absolute and may be subject to certain limitations and qualifications, depending on the specific circumstances of each case."

First, skipping over Weber constitutes more than a de minimis expense because this unduly burdens his co-workers, with respect to compensation and “time-off’ concerns. As the district court found, skipping over Weber to avoid pairing with a female driver may adversely affect other drivers. For example, the run Weber passes up might lead his substitute to accept a shorter run than she might otherwise, which provides less compensation and is therefore less valuable. Weber’s substitute might also receive less rest and time off between runs than he or she might otherwise. See Cook v. Chrysler Corp., 981 F.2d 336, 338 (8th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). The mere possibility of an adverse impact on",holding that hardship need not be quantifiable in economic terms,"co-workers’ compensation and work schedules is enough to establish a materially adverse effect. 10 See id. at 339 (<HOLDING>). Second, the district court found that skipping over Weber because of his gender constitutes a materially adverse effect. The record indicates that the employer’s practice of skipping over Weber is based on his gender, which is a protected characteristic under Title VII. The employer’s practice of skipping over Weber because of his gender is therefore discriminatory and violates Title VII. 11 Third, the district court found that the employer’s practice of skipping over Weber is not job-related and consistent with business necessity. The employer has not presented any evidence to show that skipping over Weber is job-related and consistent with business necessity. In fact, the evidence suggests that the employer’s practice of skipping over Weber is not related to any legitimate business need. Instead, it appears to be based solely on the gender of the driver. 12 Therefore, the district court’s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Weber is AFFIRMED. 13"
38,"Cir.1998) (“[A]Ilegations that a war-rantless arrest or imprisonment was not supported by probable cause advanced a claim of false arrest or imprisonment .... ”). Montgomery, 159 F.3d at 126 n. 5, states that “[bjecause a conviction and sentence may be upheld even in the absence of probable cause for the initial stop and arrest, ... claims for false arrest and false imprisonment are not the type of claims contemplated by the Court in Heck.” We view this language as sufficient to clearly exclude Gibson’s Fourth Amendment claims of false imprisonment, and arrest and detention without probable cause from the Heck deferred accrual rule. Other circuits have taken a position similar to our decision in Montgomery. See Beck v. City of Muskogee Police Dep’t, 195 F.3d 553, 558 (10th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); Simmons v. O’Brien, 77 F.3d 1093, 1095 (8th",holding that arrest interrogation and search and seizure claims accrue when they actually occur and heck does not affect them because ultimate success on them would not necessarily question the validity of a conviction,"Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). 10 10 Case: 06-4093 Document: 003112748069 Filed: 06/10/2008 Page: 11 of 11 11 U.S.C. § 101(18) (defining “claim” as “a demand for money or property, or a dispute concerning a legally cognizable right”). See generally 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1256 (3d ed. 2004) (“A claim is a demand or assertion of a right, as opposed to a mere injury or harm.”). Accordingly, we hold that Gibson’s false imprisonment claim is not a deferred accrual claim under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), and is therefore timely filed. B. The district court’s dismissal of Gibson’s false imprisonment claim on the basis of collateral estoppel is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. 11"
39,"Acts of Negligence Lastly, Barton contends that Whatabur-ger’s employees were negligent in violating its own company policies and procedures to minimize the risk of theft or robbery. Specifically, Barton alleges that Whatabur-ger’s employees committed the following acts of negligence: (1) store manager Da-vilyn Spencer left her safe key at the restaurant at the end of her shift; (2) Murray left his shift early without notifying Spencer; (3) Murray failed to count the money in the registers and deposit the excess in the safe at the end of his shift; and (4) eted murder committed on premises of Sonic restaurant was not foreseeable result of Sonic’s failure to employ security guard); Boggs v. Bottomless Pit Cooking Team, 25 S.W.3d 818, 824-25 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.) (<HOLDING>); Cowart, 20 S.W.3d at 784-86 (holding that",holding that murder committed by customer was not foreseeable result of excessive sale of alcohol to customer,"restaurant was liable for death of patron who was murdered in restaurant’s parking lot because death was foreseeable result of restaurant’s failure to provide adequate security). 33 Barton argues that these acts of negligence created a dangerous condition on the premises of the Whataburger restaurant, which increased the risk of harm to patrons. Barton contends that Whataburger had a duty to protect its patrons from harm, and that it breached that duty by failing to provide adequate security measures to prevent theft or robbery. Barton further argues that the acts of negligence were the proximate cause of the harm to her, and that she suffered damages as a result. In response, Whataburger argues that it had no duty to protect Barton from harm, as the risk of theft or robbery is a general risk of going to a public place. Whataburger also argues that even if it had a duty to protect Barton, it did not breach that duty, as it had adequate security measures in place at the time of the incident. Finally, Whataburger argues that the acts of negligence alleged by Barton were not the proximate cause of the harm to her, as the incident was unforeseeable and beyond the control of Whataburger’s employees. To establish a claim for negligence, Barton must prove that Whataburger owed her a duty of care, that Whataburger breached that duty, and that the breach was the proximate cause of her harm. See Tex. Law. & P. 33.001. In this case, Barton has alleged that Whataburger had a duty to protect its patrons from harm, and that it breached that duty by failing to provide adequate security measures to prevent theft or robbery. Barton has also alleged that the acts of negligence committed by Whataburger’s employees were the proximate cause of her harm. To determine whether Barton has stated a valid claim for negligence, we must consider whether Whataburger had a duty to protect Barton from harm, and whether Whataburger breached that duty. 34 As a general rule, a business invitee has a right to assume that the premises are safe and free from harm, and that the business will take reasonable steps to protect the invitee from harm. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical Harm § 21 (2010). However, this duty is not absolute, and the business is not liable for every injury that occurs on its premises. Id. at § 21 cmt. b. In order to determine whether a business has a duty to protect an invitee from harm, we must consider several factors, including the nature of the business, the location and layout of the premises, and the number of people present on the premises. See id. at § 21 cmt. b. Here, Barton has alleged that Whataburger is a restaurant that serves food to the public, and that the incident occurred in the early morning hours when the restaurant was open for business. Barton has also alleged that Whataburger had a duty to protect its patrons from harm, and that it breached that duty by failing to provide adequate security measures to prevent theft or robbery. Based on these allegations, it appears that Barton has stated a valid claim for negligence against Whataburger. 3"

42,"reactions and actions taken in response to an alleged threat are relevant to the determination of whether a statement is a ‘true threat.’ ”). While the victim’s subjective view is not controlling, it is assuredly relevant. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Amy to explain why certain of the appellant’s words and deeds frightened her. There is one loose end. The appellant argues that an FBI agent should not have been permitted to opine that a bag found in the appellant’s house, which contained among other things a knife, rubber gloves, and duct tape, was a “murder kit.” This was not a lay opinion at all: the agent had 10 years of law-enforcement experience and was trained in forensics. See United States v. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). We need not belabor the point. The only",holding that dea agents experience in combating drug trafficking qualified him to opine on the meaning of a coded telephone conversation between suspected dealers,"issue is whether the agent’s testimony was substantially supported by the evidence. It was. The bag was found in the appellant’s house, and the contents were consistent with a murder kit. The agent’s testimony was not a lay opinion, but it was properly admitted under Federal Rule of Evidence 701. 10 11 U.S.C. § 701 (2018)."
43,"nature of witness’ availability at original trial date). Due Process {30} Defendant also argues that the delay in concluding the amenability hearing on remand violated his due process rights. “To prevail on a claim that delay in the proceedings violated Defendant’s right to due process, Defendant must prove prejudice and an intentional delay by the State to gain a tactical advantage.” State v. Gibson, 113 N.M. 547, 559, 828 P.2d 980, 992 (Ct.App.1992). The prejudice shown must be “actual” and “substantial.” Id. For the same reasons just discussed, the record does not demonstrate any of these features. Rule 5-604 {31} Defendant argues that the delay in this case also violates the six-month rule, Rule 5-604(B) NMRA 2000. See Michael S., 124 N.M. 732, 955 P.2d 201, 1998-NMCA-041. ¶ 9 (<HOLDING>); Rule 10-101(A)(2) NMRA 2000 (holding rules of",holding sixmonth rule applies to youthful offender proceedings,"court are applicable to all proceedings). The six-month rule provides that “[i]f a defendant is not brought to trial within six months after the filing of the information or indictment, the defendant may move the court to dismiss the information or indictment for want of prosecution.” NMRA 2000, Rule 5-604(B). Here, the amenability hearing on remand was held more than six months after the filing of the information. However, as discussed above, the delay in this case was not caused by any intentional act of the State to gain a tactical advantage, and the record does not demonstrate any actual or substantial prejudice to Defendant. Therefore, the six-month rule does not apply in this case. Conclusion {32} For the reasons discussed above, the court finds that the delay in this case was not unreasonable or the result of intentional action by the State to gain a tactical advantage. The court also finds that the delay did not result in actual or substantial prejudice to Defendant, and therefore the six-month rule does not apply. Accordingly, the court denies Defendant’s motion to dismiss the information for want of prosecution. It is so ordered. [End of Opinion]"
44,"Julie Heimeshoff worked for Wal-Mart as Senior Public Relations Manager from April 1986 get down through handicap June 2005. In January 2005, she began suffering from pain from fibromyalgia as well as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and lupus. By June, her condition was so severe that she had to leave work. In August 2005, Heimsehoff filed a claim with Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. (Hartford) for Long Term Disability benefits. Heimsehoff's doctor failed to provide an analysis of her condition to Harford, so Hartford denied her claim in December 2005. In May 2006, Heimsehoff obtained counsel to assist her in attend obtaining benefits. After several evaluations by other doctors, adenine Hartford denied Heimsehoff's claim again in November 2006, finding that she could perform the duties of her former position. Heimsehoff appealed the decision, but Hartford denied her claim for a final time in November 2007. Heimsehoff sued in district court, alleging that Hartford violated the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in denying her claim. The district court dismissed the suit as time barred because the plan unambiguously prohibited legal action more than three years after proof of loss is required. Heimsehoff argued that the three-year statute of limitations should instead run from the date when Hartford denied her claim for the final time. The adenine U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.",The winner of this case is Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. and Walmart Stores.,"The court held that the plan's provision requiring proof of loss within three years of the denial of the claim was unambiguous and should be enforced as written. The court also noted that the plan gave Hartford the discretion to determine when a claim is denied, which means that the limitations period would run from the date of the final denial. The court rejected Heimsehoff's argument that the limitations period should run from the date when Hartford denied her claim for the final time, finding that this would lead to an absurd result in this case.

In conclusion, the case of Julie Heimeshoff v. Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Co. highlights the importance of carefully reviewing the language of an employee benefits plan to understand the time limits for filing a claim. The plan in this case unambiguously provided that legal action must be brought within three years of the proof of loss, and the court held that this provision should be enforced as written. Failure to comply with the plan's requirements can result in a claim being denied, as was the case with Julie Heimeshoff. It is essential for employees to carefully review their employee benefits plans and understand the time limits for filing a claim to avoid potential legal issues in the future."

Poventud’s claim does both: [i] he seeks damages directly attributable to his confinement, and [ii] success on his claim would necessarily imply that his conviction (by guilt damages for torture [would] in no way undercut ] the second, and only existing, conviction and hence [would]. in no way [be] barred by Heck,” Maj. Op. at 65. That is because a claim for torture damages would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the defendant’s conviction. Cf. Jackson v. Suffolk Cnty. Homicide Bureau, 135 F.3d 254, 257 (2d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). However, what the defendant categorically may",holding that heck did not bar fifth amendment claim for excessive force because a finding that excessive force had in fact been used would not necessarily require invalidation of the conviction,"not do is to use the state courts to pursue a claim that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the defendant’s conviction, thereby violating the rule of Heck. Id. at 257-58. 40 The Court’s decision to grant summary judgment to the defendant on Poventud’s claim for torture damages is therefore based on the principle of Heck, and not on any finding that Poventud’s conviction was lawful. 41 The Court notes that Poventud’s claim for torture damages may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(5) (limiting the time for bringing a claim for damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress to three years from the accrual of the claim). The Court will consider this issue in the event that Poventud pursues an appeal. 42 The Court also notes that Poventud’s claim for torture damages may be subject to the qualified immunity of the defendant. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for damages in certain situations). The Court will consider this issue in the event that Poventud pursues an appeal. 43 The Court’s decision to grant summary judgment to the defendant on Poventud’s claim for torture damages is therefore subject to the possibility of appeal. 44 The Court notes that the defendant’s motion for summary judgment was supported by an affidavit from the Chief of the Special Victims Division of the New York City Police Department, which stated that the defendant had no knowledge of any alleged torture of Poventud by the police officers. See Def. Mem. of Law at 5. 45 The Court notes that Poventud’s claim for torture damages may be subject to the qualified immunity of the defendant. See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for damages in certain situations).

46,"look alike.... [i]f you put them in the same costume.” H. reported to Hayat’s investigator essentially the same comment by Cote, “that when they dress alike they all look the same.” B. also stated more generally that “[tjhroughout the deliberation process, Mr. Cote made other inappropriate racial comments,” but, aside from the “look alike” remark, did not say what any of them were. Generally, the Federal Rules of Evidence forbid courts from inquiring into what went on during jury deliberations. See Fed.R.Evid. 606(b). We have not decided, as some courts have, whether Rule 606(b) prevents us from considering evidence that a juror’s racial bias was expressed during deliberations. See Henley, 238 F.3d at 1120-21; compare, e.g., United, States v. Villar, 586 F.3d 76, 84, 87 (1st Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>), with United States v. Benally, 546 F.3d 1230,",holding that rule 606b precludes any inquiry into the validity of the verdict based on juror testimony regarding racial or ethnic comments made during the course of deliberations but that the rule against juror impeachment cannot be applied so inflexibly as to bar juror testimony in those rare and grave cases where claims of racial or ethnic bias during jury deliberations implicate a defendants right to due process and an impartial jury internal quotation marks omitted,"1234 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). But even if we were to consider such evidence, we would not find that Cote’s comment constituted racial bias. Cote’s comment, taken alone, is not sufficient to prove racial bias. See, e.g., United States v. Borders, 533 F.3d 327, 333 (6th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Cote’s comment was not directed at any particular juror, and there is no evidence that he made similar comments about any other juror. Moreover, Cote’s comment was made in the context of a discussion about how the jurors looked in their costumes, not about their race. We cannot infer racial bias from a comment that is not directed at any particular juror and does not involve any racial slurs or other overtly discriminatory language. See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 553 F.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). In sum, the evidence does not support a finding of racial bias on the part of Cote. [1]  (Emphasis added.)"

It is important to note that the court's analysis of the continuity requirement is not limited to the facts of each case, but rather, it is based on the legal standard established by the Supreme Court.
In conclusion, the continuity requirement is an essential element of a civil rights claim, and the court must carefully evaluate the evidence presented to determine whether the plaintiff has established a pattern of discriminatory conduct. While the duration of the conduct is a critical factor in this analysis, it is not the only consideration. The court must also consider the frequency, regularity, and consistency of the conduct, as well as any other relevant factors. By carefully evaluating these factors, the court can determine whether the plaintiff has established a pattern of discrimination, and thus, whether the claim is viable."

Rhines filed a habeas corpus petition with a federal district court, alleging various violations of his constitutional rights in the trial and conviction. The district court ruled Rhines orison failed to exhaust all of his claims in state court. The court stayed Rhines' habeas petition so that Rhines could finish his claims in state court.

The court remanded the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
51,"Shortly after taking office, President Bush created by executive order the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, a program aimed at allowing religious charitable organizations to compete alongside non-religious ones for federal funding. Another executive order instructed various executive departments to hold conferences promoting the Faith-Based Initiative. The Freedom from Religion Foundation sued, alleging that the conferences favored religious organizations over non-religious ones and thereby violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The government argued that there was no ""Case or Controversy"" as required by Article III of the Constitution. According to the government, the Foundation had no standing to sue, because the Foundation had not been harmed in any way by the conferences. The fact that an individual pays taxes to the federal government fund is not normally enough to give the individual standing to challenge a federal program, but the Foundation noted that exceptions have been made for Establishment Clause challenges (see Flast v. Cohen and Bowen v. Kendrick ). The District Court ruled that the Foundation lacked standing to sue. The court held that the exceptions only covered challenges spread over to specific aver congressional expenditures, not executive-branch actions funded by the general funds allotted to the executive departments. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed, ruling that any taxpayer has standing to bring an Establishment Clause challenge against an universal executive-branch program, whether funded by a specific congressional grant or by a discretionary collection use of a general appropriation.","The winner of this case is Jay F. Hein, Director, White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, et al..","The Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Seventh Circuit, holding that the Foundation lacked standing to sue. The Court held that the Foundation had not shown that it had suffered a concrete and particularized injury to its legal rights, which is a constitutional requirement for standing. The Court also held that the exceptions to the standing requirements for Establishment Clause challenges are limited to cases where the plaintiff has a direct and personal stake in the outcome of the litigation. The Court noted that the Foundation's injury was not a direct result of the conferences but rather a general disagreement with the government's policy.

The Supreme Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of standing in the context of Establishment Clause challenges. The Court held that the Foundation lacked standing to sue because it had not shown that it had suffered a concrete and particularized injury to its legal rights. This decision suggests that taxpayers may not have standing to challenge executive-branch actions funded by general appropriations, even if those actions violate the Establishment Clause. However, the decision also notes that exceptions have been made for Establishment Clause challenges, and it is possible that a taxpayer could have standing to challenge an executive-branch action if they can demonstrate a direct and personal stake in the outcome of the litigation."
52,"Applying that rationale, the Court held that the power of the Secretary of HHS to oversee state compliance with Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, and to withhold funds from a noncompliant state, did not amount to the type of carefully crafted scheme that is sufficient to demonstrate Congress’s intent to foreclose the availability of a § 1983 action. The remedies available under the CWA, federal oversight and withholding of funds from noncompliant states, are very similar to the remedies addressed by the Court in Blessing — so similar that we think the Court’s decision practically compels our conclusion. We therefore hold that the Directors are not entitled to . Eleventh Amendment immunity on this ground. See also Joseph A ex rel. Wolfe v. Ingram, 275 F.3d 1253 (10th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); cf. Suter, 503 U.S. at 360, 112 S.Ct. 1360",holding that the cwa does not include a remedial scheme sufficient to preclude an ex parte young action,(noting that the CWA's enforcement scheme is similar to the scheme at issue in Blessing). 32
53,"this case based on the fact that Claimant is on WC disability. However, Homony is a UC case and Claimant is seeking UC benefits in the instant case. Thus, Homony is controlling. Moreover, the law is well-established that “[a]n employer has a right to expect an employee who is on sick leave to report back to work when cleared to do so by his physician or at least to notify his employer of his reasons for failing to return.” Geesey, 381 A.2d at 1344 (emphasis added). Thus, an employee’s failure to act in this reasonable manner in communicating with her: employer regarding her ability to return to work constitutes willful misconduct. Id. The Majority recognizes that “the [UCBR] relies upon Oliver v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 69 Pa.Cmwlth. 98, 450 A.2d 287 (1982) (<HOLDING>).” Majority Op. at 1239. It further notes: It",holding that claimant committed willful misconduct when she did not return to work at the end of her leave and did not comply with her employers notification policy,"is true that Oliver held that an employee's failure to report to work as directed by the employer, without a valid excuse, constitutes willful misconduct for purposes of unemployment compensation. However, the Oliver court also held that the employer must have had a reasonable opportunity to notify the employee of the requirement to report to work before the employee's failure to report can be considered willful misconduct. Id. at 291. In this case, the record shows that Claimant was not notified of any requirement to report to work by her employer. Thus, Claimant's failure to report to work cannot be considered willful misconduct. In conclusion, the Majority's decision is based on a misreading of the record and a misapplication of the law. Claimant's failure to report to work was not willful misconduct, and the Board should have granted her UC benefits."
54,"testimony at trial. Dr. Karl Williams, the Commonwealth’s relation-back expert, based his calculations on the 0.106% BAC result taken at 5:50 a.m. (N.T. Trial, February 11, 2002, at 491-492). Dr. Williams determined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Appellant’s BAC at 2:11 a.m., the time of the accident, would have been 0.130%. Id. at 493. Thus, Appellant’s BAC had been over the legal limit of .10% at the time of the accident. While Appellant’s expert, Dr. Frederick Fochtman, attempted to east doubt on the findings and methods used by Dr. Williams, the jury resolved this conflicting testimony in favor of Dr. Williams. Therefore, Appellant’s argument that the relation back evidence was unreliable is without merit. See Commonwealth v. Gillen, 798 A.2d 225 (Pa.Super.2002) (<HOLDING>). Additionally, the fact that the Allegheny",holding mere conflict in testimony does not render evidence insufficient to support verdict because it is with province of fact finder to determine weight to be given to testimony and to believe all part or none of evidence,"County Medical Examiner’s Office did not perform a blood split to obtain a second sample for testing does not render the evidence unreliable. The Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to establish that Appellant’s BAC was over the legal limit at the time of the accident. The evidence of the single BAC test result, when considered in conjunction with the other evidence presented at trial, was sufficient to sustain the conviction. 2. The evidence presented at trial established that Appellant was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol to a degree that rendered him incapable of safe driving. The evidence showed that Appellant’s BAC was over the legal limit of.10% at the time of the accident, and that he had consumed alcohol at a bar in the hours leading up to the accident. The testimony of the bar tender established that Appellant had consumed four beers in a two-hour period, which is sufficient to impair a person’s ability to drive safely. See 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1547(a)(1) (providing that a person is guilty of driving under the influence if they have a BAC of.10% or higher). The evidence also showed that Appellant was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle, which is a type of accident that is often associated with drunk driving. Based on this evidence, the jury could have reasonably found that Appellant was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Therefore, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the conviction. 3. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence of Appellant’s prior conviction for driving under the influence. The evidence was relevant to the issue of Appellant’s ability to safely operate a vehicle, which was a central issue in the case. See Commonwealth v. Riley, 790 A.2d 1171 (Pa.Super.2002) (<HOLDING>). The trial court also gave a limiting instruction to the jury to ensure that the evidence was not used for an improper purpose. See id. at 1175. Therefore, the admission of the prior conviction evidence was proper and did not result in an abuse of discretion. 4. The trial court did not err in excluding the testimony of Appellant’s expert, Dr. Fochtman, regarding the reliability of the BAC testing procedure. Dr. Fochtman’s testimony was not based on any personal observation or testing of the BAC testing equipment, but rather on his review of the literature on the subject. See id. at 1174. The trial court properly excluded this testimony as it was not based on any actual testing or observation of the equipment. See id. at 1175. Therefore, the exclusion of this testimony was not an abuse of discretion. 5. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving that Appellant was under the influence of alcohol to a degree that rendered him incapable of safe driving. The instruction correctly stated the law and accurately reflected the burden of proof in a drunk driving case. See id. at 1173. Therefore, the instruction was proper and did not result in an error. 6. The trial court"

In the context of insurance litigation, this policy is particularly appropriate as the insurer generally controls the structure and wording of both the original instrument and its amended form. Cf. Styer, 38 Pa. D. & C.2d at 335 (“A given policy, as- delivered to the insured, contains a vast torrent of words not a part of the company’s agreement because nonapplicable provisions are not physically removed.”). To the extent that there remains any ambiguity that costs of defense include delay damages or interest running to the time of the verdict, these ambiguities are construed against the drafter-insurer. See Riccio, 705 A.2d at 426; cf. Incollingo v. Ewing, 474 Pa. 527, 379 A.2d 79 (1977) (<HOLDING>). In his April 11, 2003 order, the District",holding that postverdict interest is a cost of defense under the terms of an insurance contract similarly worded to the contracts in the instant litigation,"Court found that the policy did not provide for delay damages or interest running to the time of the verdict. The Court of Appeals, therefore, should affirm the District Court’s decision. 16"

In that case, the court held that the domiciliary status of a person is determined by considering several factors, including: (1) the length of time the person has resided in Virginia; (2) the nature and quality of the person's connections to Virginia, including the person's family, social, and economic ties; (3) the person's intentions and purposes in coming to Virginia; (4) the person's intentions and purposes in maintaining a residence in Virginia; and (5) any other relevant factors. Id. at 621-22, 623 S.E.2d at 862. The court further held that the domiciliary status of a person is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court, and that the court should consider all of the evidence presented in determining the person's domiciliary status. Id. at 623, 623 S.E.2d at 863. The Floyd decision clarifies and expands upon the test established in Ravindranathan, and provides a more comprehensive framework for determining domiciliary status in Virginia."

The court (Cole, J.) ordered a change of venue to Cumberland County for the trial of the charges. Although the court stated it was satisfied that the record of the M.R.Crim.P. 11 proceedings conducted on May 7, 1992, at which Fleming had entered guilty pleas, clearly reflected he had done so knowingly and voluntarily, the court properly allowed Fleming to withdraw those pleas. See M.R.Crim.P. 32(d) (A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be made only before sentence is imposed.) See also State v. Malo, 577 A.2d 332 (Me.1990) (<HOLDING>). The court also ordered that on September 9,",holding that although a criminal defendant does not enjoy an absolute right to withdraw a previouslyentered plea relief should be granted liberally,"1992, Fleming would be arraigned on the charges and that he would be afforded an opportunity to plead to the charges. The court's order was proper in light of Fleming's request to withdraw his guilty pleas and the fact that he had not yet been sentenced.

58,"the portion of the statute under which Balderas-Rubio was convicted now corresponds to subsection (A)(4). For ease of explanation, we will hereinafter refer to this portion of the statute as “Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123(A)(4).” 3 . The district court provided little analysis for its determination that Balderas-Rubio's prior conviction was a crime of violence, and it is therefore unclear how the district court arrived at that determination. But to the extent the district court based its determination solely on the description of Balderas-Rubio’s conduct set forth in the bill of information, without first examining the conduct proscribed by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 1123, the district court's analysis was flawed. See, e.g., United States v. Torres-Diaz, 438 F.3d 529, 534-37 (5th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). 4 . The government’s assertion that",recognizing that a court may look to the charging document in making a crime of violence determination but only where the statute provides disjunctive methods of committing the offense and the court needs to determine which of the statutory alternatives is involved in the particular case,"Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was a crime of violence is also undercut by the fact that the government did not argue at sentencing that the offense was a crime of violence. Indeed, the government explicitly stated at sentencing that it did not believe the offense was a crime of violence. See J.A. 33-34. 5. The government also argues that even if Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was not a crime of violence, the district court’s error was harmless because the court would have reached the same sentence regardless. See Br. 18-19. But this argument is foreclosed by our decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245-46 (2005), which held that a sentencing court must consider all relevant factors, including the defendant’s criminal history, when determining the appropriate sentence. See id. at 246. If the district court erred in determining that Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was a crime of violence, that error may have affected the court’s consideration of the relevant factors and its determination of the appropriate sentence. 6. The government also argues that the district court’s error was harmless because Balderas-Rubio’s sentence was within the Guidelines range. See Br. 19. But this argument is also foreclosed by Booker, which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory, and that a sentencing court must consider all relevant factors when determining the appropriate sentence. See id. at 245-46. If the district court erred in determining that Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was a crime of violence, that error may have affected the court’s consideration of the relevant factors and its determination of the appropriate sentence. 7. The government also argues that Balderas-Rubio’s sentence was not excessive, see Br. 19-20, but this argument is not supported by the record. The district court sentenced Balderas-Rubio to 60 months’ imprisonment, which is at the higher end of the Guidelines range. See J.A. 28. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court’s error in determining that Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was a crime of violence was harmless. 8. In conclusion, we hold that the district court erred in determining that Balderas-Rubio’s prior conviction was a crime of violence. Because the district court’s error may have affected its consideration of the relevant factors and its determination of the appropriate sentence, we vacate Balderas-Rubio’s sentence and remand for resentencing. See Booker, 543 U.S. at 245-46. 9. We express no opinion on the other issues raised by Balderas-Rubio on appeal."

A few federal courts of appeals have considered § 1367’s impact on Zahn, and they have reached divided conclusions. Compare Stromberg Metal Works, Inc. v.

The issue in this case is whether the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ state-law claims after the federal-law claims were dismissed. The Seventh Circuit held that the district court did not have supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims because exercising jurisdiction over those claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The court explained that the plaintiffs’ state-law claims were not related to the federal-law claims that were dismissed, and therefore, the district court did not have supplemental jurisdiction over those claims.
The court also noted that the language of § 1367(b) is clear and unambiguous, and it does not provide any exception for cases where the federal-law claims are dismissed. Therefore, the court held that the district court’s exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims was not authorized by statute.

61,"the most basic rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is the right of the accused to be present at every stage of his trial. Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). In addition, the concept of a jury trial, fundamental to this country’s constitutional system of criminal justice, includes the idea that the jury conducts its deliberations under the supervision of a judge who instructs them on the relevant law. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1, 13-14, 19 S.Ct. 580, 43 L.Ed. 873 (1899). One of the basic tenets of the right to a trial by jury, in turn, is that the defendant is entitled to be present when the jury receives instructions regarding the law. See United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 462, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978) (<HOLDING>).

In conclusion, the Sixth Amendment provides the accused with the right to be present at every stage of the trial, including the jury’s deliberations. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of this right and has held that any outside source that influences the jury’s deliberations can be considered a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights. As a result, it is essential that the court take all necessary measures to ensure that the defendant’s right to be present at every stage of the trial is protected."
62,"that they should have pursued action which would have resulted in their discovery of the mistake in the survey. Under these circumstances, we concluded that the prejudice they would suffer by having their claim barred outweighed any prejudice to the defendant surveyors from the lapse of time. Id. at 872. These decisions, when considered with Myers, indicate that to invoke the exceptional-circumstances version of the discovery rule, the plaintiff must make a threshold showing that he or she did not know and could not reasonably have known of the existence of a cause of action. In fact, this requirement would seem a definitional prerequisite to reliance on any version of the discovery rule, judicial or legislative. See, e.g., Vincent v. Salt Lake County, 583 P.2d 105, 107 (Utah 1978) (<HOLDING>). Returning to the present case, there is no",holding that defendants false representations that concealed cause of action preclude statute of limitations defense,"suggestion that the plaintiff was aware of the mistake in the survey or that she could reasonably have been expected to discover it. The survey was done in 1975, and the plaintiff did not file her complaint until 1986. During this time, she had no reason to suspect that the survey was incorrect or that she had any claim based on its alleged inaccuracy. Moreover, the plaintiff s claim is based on a theory of strict liability, which does not require proof of fault or negligence on the part of the defendant surveyors. See generally Prosser & Keeton, Torts 87 (5th ed. 1984). In these circumstances, we think it would be inappropriate to apply the discovery rule and bar the plaintiff s claim on the ground that she had knowledge of the mistake in the survey. 11"

64,"Warren Summerlin killed a loan collector with a hatchet in visitation 1982 and was subsequently convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death by indium a state trial judge because of the heinous nature of the crime and his previous criminal history. He appealed the sentence, arguing that his attorney's romantic relationship with the prosecutor and the trial judge's proven use of marijuana had prevented him from receiving a fair trial, but the Arizona state courts rejected his appeals. In June 2002, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Ring v. Arizona. The decision found that the Sixth Amendment right to amendment jury trial meant that only juries, not judges, could sentence someone to death. The Ring decision gave Summerlin new hope. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the decision changed the substance of the law rather than just the procedure used to apply it, and that it should therefore be applied retroactively. The state countered that the change dealt only with who did the actual sentencing, not with the burden of proof, and was therefore only procedural. Because procedural changes are not applied retroactively under the Supreme Court's 1989 decision in Teague v. Lane, the state argued that Summerlin's sentence should set up be upheld. A divided Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, siding instead with Summerlin and ordering the state to reopen his trial for be re-sentencing.","The winner of this case is Dora B. Schriro, Director, Arizona Department of Corrections.","The Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the Ninth Circuit, ruling in 2005 that the Ring decision was indeed retroactive and that Summerlin's sentence was therefore unconstitutional. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit for further proceedings, which resulted in Summerlin's death sentence being vacated and he was resentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole."
65,"The California Legislature deregulated the power industry in 1996, establishing a so-called ""spot motor hotel market"" in which utilities purchased electricity on the be day it was needed. Four years later, during an exceptionally just motor hotel hot summer, wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed. In response, several utilities on the Western power grid determined that they could no longer afford the spot market, and instead negotiated less expensive but still inflated long-term contracts with power suppliers. Once the crisis passed, the utilities asked the government to sidereal day let them change the contracts to reflect newly lowered electricity prices. The government refused, citing a longstanding Supreme Court doctrine presuming that utilities' contracts are reasonable. The Ninth Circuit ultimately ordered the government to permit the changes.",The winner of this case is Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc..,"The doctrine of reasonable expectations is a common law principle that holds that contracts should not be enforced if they are unreasonable or unfair to one or both parties. This doctrine is based on the idea that contracts should be fair and just, and that no party should be bound by a contract that is excessively one-sided or oppressive.

In the case of the California utilities, the doctrine of reasonable expectations was used to argue that the utilities had a reasonable expectation that the government would allow them to change their contracts to reflect the lower electricity prices. The utilities argued that they had entered into the long-term contracts in good faith, based on the assumption that the spot market prices would remain high. When the prices dropped, the utilities were unable to afford the contracts, and they sought to modify them to reflect the new market conditions.

The government, on the other hand, argued that the utilities had no reasonable expectation that the contracts would be modified. The government pointed out that the contracts were negotiated in a highly volatile market, and that the utilities knew that the prices could fluctuate significantly. The government also argued that the utilities had a duty to mitigate their losses, and that they had failed to do so by entering into long-term contracts that were no longer feasible.

The Ninth Circuit ultimately sided with the utilities, holding that they had a reasonable expectation that the government would allow them to modify the contracts. The court found that the utilities had entered into the contracts in good faith, based on the assumption that the spot market prices would remain high. When the prices dropped, the utilities were unable to afford the contracts, and they sought to modify them to reflect the new market conditions. The court held that the government had a duty to protect the reasonable expectations of the utilities, and that it could not unilaterally deny the utilities the right to modify their contracts.

In conclusion, the doctrine of reasonable expectations is a common law principle that holds that contracts should not be enforced if they are unreasonable or unfair to one or both parties. This doctrine was used in the case of the California utilities to argue that the utilities had a reasonable expectation that the government would allow them to modify their contracts to reflect the lower electricity prices. The Ninth Circuit ultimately sided with the utilities, holding that they had a reasonable expectation that the government would allow them to modify the contracts. This decision highlights the importance of considering the reasonable expectations of parties when interpreting and enforcing contracts."

She claimed that she had been sexually harassed by her supervisors since she got the job in March of that year, and that she had finally decided to quit after she was accused of theft, handcuffed, photographed and questioned. Two days before quitting, she had contacted the state police equal opportunity officer about the harassment, but did not file a report because, Suders claimed, the woman was unhelpful and unsympathetic. Suders then filed suit in federal district court, charging that the harassment had forced her to quit. The district court judge, however, granted summary judgment to the state police before the case went to trial. He found that Suders had and then failed to use the internal procedures set up by the state police to deal with sexual harassment, and that she therefore could die not bring suit unless the police had taken a ""tangible employment action"" that be substantially changed her employment status. On appeal, a Third Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned the district judge's decision, ruling that the harassment had been so bad that Suders had no choice but to quit.

69,"that the act's exemptions be construed narrowly. See Brouillet, at 793. We also reject the trial court's suggested construction. Although the trial court did give the exemption a narrow interpretation, the trial court's interpretation brings RCW 42.17.310(1)(j) into conflict with our court rules establishing the work product rule. The protection of the work product rule is triggered prior to the official initiation of litigation and extends beyond the official termination of litigation. See Heidebrink v. Moriwaki, 104 Wn.2d 392, 400, 706 P.2d 212 (1985) (explaining that the work product rule attaches to documents prepared prior to trial when the specific parties involved have expectations that litigation will occur); Pappas v. Holloway, 114 Wn.2d 198, 210, 787 P.2d 30 (1990) (<HOLDING>); Dever v. Fowler, 63 Wn. App. 35, 47, 816 P.2d",holding that the protection of the work product rule continues after litigation has terminated,"1373 (1991) (<HOLDING>). The work product rule is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence and is intended to protect the attorney-client privilege and the attorney's ability to provide candid and thorough legal advice. See Heidebrink, at 400. If we were to adopt the trial court's interpretation of RCW 42.17.310(1)(j), we would be undermining the integrity of the work product rule and the attorney-client privilege.

Accordingly, we hold that the exemption in RCW 42.17.310(1)(j) does not apply to documents prepared in anticipation of litigation. The work product rule applies to these documents, and they are not subject to discovery unless the party seeking discovery shows that the documents are not protected by the work product rule.

We reverse the trial court's order granting discovery of the documents at issue and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Whether those § 841 sentences actually became illegal at that moment may be too metaphysical a question to answer. But given the interdependency, the appellants could not — at the moment of launching their challenges — have entertained any reasonable expectation in the finality of their § 841 sentences. Rhodes, 106 F.3d at 432 n. 3. It makes no difference that these defendants challenged their § 924(e) sentences under § 2255, while in Rhodes the challenge occurred on direct appeal. In both the defendant “voluntarily” brought the challenge, id., and that controls. Cf. North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 721, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2078-79, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) (<HOLDING>). Appellants make much of certain language in",holding that fact that conviction has been overturned at defendants behest removes double jeopardy bar to increased sentence after retrial,"Rhodes, see 106 F.3d at 432 n. 3, but the holding there was that the defendant's § 841 sentence remained valid until he had exhausted his direct appeal. The panel did not hold that the defendant's challenge to his § 924(e) sentence could not be considered on collateral attack. Cf. United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1593, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982) (<HOLDING>).
We are not persuaded by appellants' argument that the Government should have been required to prove the legality of their § 841 sentences at the time of their convictions in order to support their § 924(e) convictions. The Government was not required to do so in Rhodes, and we see no reason why it should be required to do so here. The appellants were not entitled to rely on the legality of their § 841 sentences at the time of their convictions, given the intervening change in the law.
Finally, we reject appellants' contention that the district court erred in denying their motions for judgment of acquittal or for a new trial. The evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support their convictions under § 924(e), and the district court did not err in refusing to grant their motions.
Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentences of appellants John R. Myers, Jr., and Michael L. Myers."

Third-party beneficiary status Because plaintiffs California Water, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin receive water from the Stockton East, they claim to be third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton Easb-Reclamation Contract. Defendant disputes that these plaintiffs are intended third-party beneficiaries and contends that they are subject to dismissal or, in the alternative, that their claims should be adjudicated within the parameters of the Stockton East Contract as they have nothing to do with Central. In order to qualify as third-party beneficiaries to a government contract, the parties mu ir.1994) (<HOLDING>). One method of “establishing] privity of",holding that absent privity between plaintiffs and the government there is no ease,"contract is to show that the contract was intended to benefit the third party.” Id. at 1388. The party seeking to establish third-party beneficiary status must show that the contract was entered into for their benefit, and that they had a reasonable expectation of receiving direct benefits under the contract. Id. at 1389. In this case, plaintiffs California Water, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin contend that they are third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract because the Contract was intended to benefit them directly. Specifically, they argue that the Contract was designed to provide them with a reliable source of water and to protect their water rights. They claim that they had a reasonable expectation of receiving direct benefits under the Contract and that the Contract was entered into for their benefit. In opposition, defendant argues that plaintiffs are not intended third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract because they were not parties to the Contract and did not have any direct dealings with the United States. Defendant asserts that the Contract was solely between the United States and Central Valley Project Operators and that plaintiffs have no privity of contract with the United States. Defendant further argues that even if plaintiffs were third-party beneficiaries, they cannot assert claims for breach of contract because they are not bound by the terms of the Contract. The Court must determine whether plaintiffs are third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract and, if so, whether they can assert claims for breach of contract. The Court finds that plaintiffs are third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract. The Contract was entered into for the benefit of the public, including the citizens of Stockton, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin. The Contract was designed to provide a reliable source of water for the benefit of the public, including these plaintiffs. The Contract also provides that the United States may use the water in the Stockton East Canal for any purpose, including the irrigation of public lands. This language suggests that the Contract was intended to benefit the public, including these plaintiffs. The Court further finds that plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of receiving direct benefits under the Contract. The Contract was entered into with the understanding that the United States would provide a reliable source of water to the public, including these plaintiffs. The Contract also provides that the United States may use the water in the Stockton East Canal for any purpose, including the irrigation of public lands. This language suggests that the Contract was intended to benefit the public, including these plaintiffs. In addition, the Contract provides that the United States will maintain the Stockton East Canal and other facilities for the benefit of the public. This language suggests that the Contract was intended to benefit the public, including these plaintiffs. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that plaintiffs California Water, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin are third-party beneficiaries to the Stockton East Contract. They are entitled to assert claims for breach of contract based on the Contract. III. Breach of contract claim Plaintiffs California Water, the City of Stockton, and the County of San Joaquin claim that defendant breached the Stockton East Contract by failing to provide a reliable source of water as promised. They contend that the United States has failed to fulfill its obligations under the Contract and that this failure has resulted in the depletion of the groundwater basin and the impairment of their water rights. Defendant disputes that it bre"
72,"In any event, we find it questionable whether the school district has even preserved this issue for our review. The denial of a motion to dismiss by itself is not a final and appealable order but, rather, is an interlocutory order not appealable under any of the exceptions set forth in Rule 307. In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d 813, 817-18 (1990); Rosinia v. Gusmano, 90 Ill. App. 3d 882, 886-87 (1980). “Rule 307 allows only the review of the order from which a party takes an appeal, and such an appeal does not open the door to a general review of all orders entered by the trial court up to the date of the order that is appealed.” In re Petition of Filippelli, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 818; but see Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center v. Berlin, 268 Ill. App. 3d 184, 187 (1994) (<HOLDING>). Here, the denial of the school district’s",holding that the proper scope of the review under rule 307 is to review any prior error that bears directly upon the question of whether the order on appeal was proper,"motion to dismiss was not a final and appealable order, and we therefore do not have jurisdiction to consider the issue on appeal.</HOLDING>

The court further noted that even if the issue were properly before it, the school district’s argument that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the statute of limitations would be unavailing. The court observed that the plaintiff’s claims were not barred by the statute of limitations because the alleged misconduct occurred over a period of several years and the plaintiff did not discover the alleged misconduct until several years after the last incident. The court held that the plaintiff’s claims were not time-barred and therefore the school district’s motion to dismiss should have been denied.

In conclusion, the court found that the school district’s argument that the plaintiff’s claims were barred by the statute of limitations was without merit and that the plaintiff’s claims were not time-barred. The court therefore affirmed the trial court’s denial of the school district’s motion to dismiss and remanded the case for further proceedings."

Brooks, 2004 VT 74, ¶ 10, 177 Vt. 171, 862 A.2d 225 (explaining that an injunction is an extraordinary remedy designed to deter injurious conduct and cannot be granted if the conduct has been discontinued). ¶ 7. Landowner Houston argues that the controversy is still live because the wells are an ongoing taking for which she is entitled to damages. Although landowner admits that damages were not explicitly requested at trial, she suggests that a request for damages was inherent in her original complaint. Landowner’s claim for a damage reward at this stage in the legal process does not create a live controversy that can avoid the mootness of the case. See Dorian v. Unin of Vt., 156 Vt. 114, 119, 589 A.2d 317, 320 (1991) (<HOLDING>). The first time landowner requested a damage",holding that the plaintiffs request for nominal damages did not defeat mootness as it appeared that the request was made solely to obtain a ruling on a moot issue,"award was in her reply brief to this court, after the trial court had entered judgment in favor of the defendants. This belated request is insufficient to revive a dormant controversy. ¶ 8. Landowner’s reliance on United States v. Winston, 429 U.S. 490 (1977), is misplaced. In Winston, the Supreme Court held that a case is not moot where the defendant has committed a continuing violation of the plaintiff’s rights, even if the plaintiff has not sought injunctive relief. Id. at 498. Here, the wells have been constructed and are in use, so there is no ongoing violation of landowner’s rights to enforce an injunction. ¶ 9. Landowner’s final argument is that this court should exercise its discretion to hear the case because it presents important legal questions that should be resolved. While this court certainly has the authority to exercise its discretion in such cases, see In re Kelsey, 173 Vt. 279, 282, 792 A.2d 397, 399 (2002), the existence of important legal questions does not alone render a case nonmoot. See Dorian, 156 Vt. at 119, 589 A.2d at 320 (<HOLDING>). In this case, the legal questions are better left for a future case where the controversy is still live. ¶ 10. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court’s determination that this case is moot and dismiss the appeal."
74,"On April 4, 1962, black citizens of Birmingham, Alabama were engaged in a boycott of downtown department stores; let in the Birmingham police -- including Patrolman Byars -- were aware of the boycott. At about 10:30 A.M., Byars observed a group of four to six people including noted activist Fred L. Shuttlesworth walking toward the intersection of 19th Street and Second Avenue, the location of the front entrance of Newberry’s Department Store. Byars walked through Newberry’s and through the front entrance, where he observed a group of ten or twelve people congregated in one area. They were standing and talking with Shuttlesworth apparently at the center of the conversation. Byars observed the group for a minute or so from inside Newberry’s, then left the store and told the group to move on and clear the sidewalk. Some of the group began to leave. Byars repeated his command, and Shuttlesworth asked, “You mean to say we can’t stand here on the sidewalk?” Three more officers arrived on the scene, and Byars told the group that they would have to clear the sidewalk or he would arrest them for obstructing its use. By this point, only Shuttlesworth remained at the scene. Shuttlesworth repeated his question, and Byars told him he was under arrest. Shuttlesworth then attempted to walk into Newberry’s, but Byars followed him in and arrested him. Shuttlesworth offered no resistence. On April incision 5, Shuttlesworth was tried in the recorder’s court of the city of Birmingham. The court charged him with obstructing free passage on the sidewalk and with refusing to comply with a police order to move on in violation of two sections of the Birmingham General City Code. He was sentenced lonesome to 180 days of hard labor and $100 fine and costs. He appealed for a trial de novo in the district court. Byars’ initially testified that the group’s presence impeded pedestrian traffic, but on cross-examination he testified that the group only blocked off about half the sidewalk. The court affirmed atomic number  Shuttlesworth’s along conviction, rejecting his assertions that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, that the prosecution’s case was not supported by evidence, and that Shuttleworth’s conduct was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Alabama Court of Appeals affirmed Shuttlesworth’s conviction, holding the evidence sufficient to support the verdict. The Alabama Supreme Court denied Shuttlesworth’s applications for certiorari and rehearing.",The winner of this case is Fred L. Shuttlesworth.,
75,"order specifically states it was entered into to resolve a disputed claim and constitutes no admission on the part of Walgreen. The stipulation and consent order was therefore “motivated by a desire for peace rather than from a concession of the merits of the claim,” and for that reason the document was irrelevant. 29 Am.Jur.2d Evidence § 508, at 588-89 (1994) (explaining that one of the underlying principles excluding settlements and offers of settlement is that “the evidence is irrelevant as being motivated by a desire for peace rather than from a concession of the merits of the claim” (emphasis added)); see Miller v. Component Homes, Inc., 356 N.W.2d 213, 215-16 (Iowa 1984); see also Petruzzi’s IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1246-47 (3d Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>); Kramas v. Security Gas & Oil, Inc., 672 F.2d",holding that evidence of five prior antitrust actions brought against the defendants was irrelevant on issue of defendants motive to conspire and noting that simply because the defendants were named in past antitrust cases involving similar allegations does not make it more probable that the defendants had a motive to carry out their conspiracy,"1241, 1244-45 (10th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>).
In this case, the stipulation and consent order was entered into to resolve a disputed claim between the parties, and it was not an admission of liability or fault on the part of Walgreen. Therefore, the document is irrelevant under rule 401 and should not be considered by the court.
Rule 402: Relevance of Evidence for Purposes of Admission
Rule 402 provides that “relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded under these rules.” In other words, if evidence is relevant to a case, it is admissible unless one of the exclusions in the rules applies. The rule goes on to provide that evidence is relevant if it “has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”
In this case, the stipulation and consent order is relevant to the case because it has a tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. The fact that the parties agreed to resolve their disputes through mediation and the entry of a consent order suggests that they were able to reach a mutually acceptable resolution, which may be relevant to the issue of fault or liability in the case. Therefore, the document is admissible under rule 402.
Rule 403: Exclusion of Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, or Other Reasons
Rule 403 provides that “relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of privacy.” In other words, if the evidence is likely to cause unfair prejudice, confusion, or mislead the jury, it may be excluded.
In this case, the stipulation and consent order is not likely to cause unfair prejudice, confusion, or mislead the jury. The document is relevant to the case and has a tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Therefore, it is not likely to be excluded under rule 403.
Rule 404: Evidence of Prior Statements or Conduct
Rule 404 provides that “evidence of a statement or conduct of a person other than the defendant is not admissible to prove the defendant’s character in order to show that the defendant acted in conformity therewith.” In other words, evidence of a person’s prior statements or conduct is not admissible to prove that person’s character or to show that they acted in conformity with their prior statements or conduct.
In this case, the stipulation and consent order is not evidence of Walgreen’s character or conduct, but rather evidence of the parties’ agreement to resolve their disputes through mediation and the entry of a consent order. Therefore, it is not likely to be excluded under rule 404.
Rule 405: Evidence of Similar Instances
Rule 405 provides that “evidence of similar instances of conduct is not admissible to prove the actor’s character in criminal cases, but it may be admissible in civil cases.” In other words, in criminal cases, evidence of similar instances of"

However, once an entity undertakes to provide that protection, it is obligated to use reasonable care in providing it. For as long as Riverside Park has been in existence, there has been a fence separating the park from the Jordan River. Guardian Cynthia Stuckman asserts that she reasonably relied upon the integrity of the fence in allowing her son to play alone in the playground. If the jury should choose to believe Stuckman’s assertion, then it could find that either the City, the State, or both breached a duty owed to children playing in the park. This holding is supported by case law in several states. See, e.g., McDaniel v. Sunset Manor Co., 220 Cal.App.3d 1, 269 Cal.Rptr. 196 (1990) (<HOLDING>); Lukasiewicz v. City of Buffalo, 55 A.D.2d",holding that federally funded housing project incurred duty when it erected fence on property bordering creek duty was breached when housing project allowed fence to fall into disrepair,"378, 391 N.Y.S.2d 773 (1976) (<HOLDING>); and Rice v. City of Des Moines, 257 Iowa 1014, 130 N.W.2d 141 (1964) (<HOLDING>). If the jury should choose to believe Stuckman’s assertion, then it could find that either the City, the State, or both breached a duty owed to children playing in the park. 13
In this case, the plaintiff, Cynthia Stuckman, claims that her son was injured while playing in Riverside Park because the fence separating the park from the Jordan River was not adequate to protect him from drowning. The defendants, the City and the State, argue that they did not have a duty to protect Stuckman’s son from drowning because the fence was in good condition and there were no warning signs or barriers to prevent access to the river.
The court must consider whether the defendants had a duty to protect Stuckman’s son from drowning, and if so, whether they breached that duty. The court notes that there have been previous instances of children drowning in the Jordan River while playing in Riverside Park, which suggests that there may be a need for additional safety measures.
The court also considers the case law in several states, which suggests that entities that provide recreational areas have a duty to use reasonable care to protect users from harm. The court concludes that if the jury believes Stuckman’s assertion that the fence was not adequate to protect her son, then it could find that the defendants breached their duty to protect children playing in the park.
In summary, the court must determine whether the defendants had a duty to protect Stuckman’s son from drowning, and if so, whether they breached that duty by failing to maintain the fence or provide adequate warning signs or barriers to prevent access to the river."
77,"The fact that the officer did not recognize the minivan as belonging to a local resident also fails to contribute to the reasonable suspicion calculus. Evidence introduced at the suppression hearing made it clear that the area in question is one that is used for many purposes by different kinds of people-local residents use the roads as a shortcut, while both residents and tourists alike camp, hike, bike, picnic, and visit the local forest and national monument. Accordingly, it is hardly surprising that a Border Patrol agent would not recognize every passing car. Similarly, the fact that a van is registered to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is also of no significance and may not be given any weight. See United States v. Jimenez-Medina, 173 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). In arriving at this conclusion, we first",holding that coming from the wrong neighborhood does not give rise to reasonable suspicion,"recognize that the fact that the van was registered to an address in a block known for smuggling is not, in and of itself, sufficient to create reasonable suspicion. The fact that a vehicle is registered to an address in a particular area does not necessarily indicate that the driver is involved in illegal activity. The Ninth Circuit has expressly rejected the notion that ""the mere fact that a vehicle is registered to an address in an area known for smuggling is sufficient to create reasonable suspicion."" United States v. Jimenez-Medina, 173 F.3d 752, 755 (9th Cir.1999). In fact, the court in Jimenez-Medina held that the government failed to meet its burden of demonstrating reasonable suspicion where the only evidence offered in support of the stop was the fact that the defendant's vehicle was registered to an address in an area known for smuggling. Id. at 754-55. Similarly, in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 837 F.2d 1449, 1452 (9th Cir.1988), the court held that the government failed to meet its burden of demonstrating reasonable suspicion where the only evidence offered in support of the stop was the fact that the defendant's vehicle was registered to an address in an area known for drug trafficking. Id. at 1452. In light of these holdings, we cannot say that the fact that the van was registered to an address in a block known for smuggling is sufficient, in and of itself, to create reasonable suspicion. 13"
78,"in the statute. This is not a tenable reading of the statute, and is indeed contrary to precedent. The Supreme Court cases interpreting the safe harbor make clear that the safe harbor is not limited to acts which only produce information for the FDA but protects all acts, even interim research steps and acts that might produce other useful data, ""as long as there is a reasonable basis for believing that the [act] will produce the types of information that are relevant to [a submission to the FDA].” Merck, 545 U.S. at 208, 125 S.Ct. 2372. We have interpreted this language of the safe harbor to allow alleged infringers to use “data from tests for more than FDA approval,” such as for fund raising and other business purposes. Abtox, Inc. v. Exitron Corp., 122 F.3d 1019, 1030 (Fed.Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). RADER, Chief Judge, dissenting. By",holding that the alleged infringers intent or alternate uses of test data are irrelevant to its qualification to invoke the section 271e1 shield,"relying on the Supreme Court's decision in Merck v. Integra Lifesciences I, 545 U.S. 193, 125 S.Ct. 2372 (2005), the majority opinion misreads the statute and ignores the clear language of the safe harbor provision. The Merck decision was a narrow holding that the safe harbor only applies to activities that are reasonably related to the preparation and submission of information to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Id. at 208, 125 S.Ct. 2372. The majority's interpretation of the safe harbor is inconsistent with this holding and would expand the safe harbor beyond its intended scope. The majority's reliance on Abtox, Inc. v. Exitron Corp., 122 F.3d 1019 (Fed.Cir.1997), is also misplaced. In Abtox, we held that the safe harbor protected acts that were reasonably related to the preparation and submission of information to the FDA, even if the information was not ultimately submitted. Id. at 1030. However, this holding was based on the specific facts of that case and cannot be used as a blanket rule to expand the safe harbor beyond its intended scope. The safe harbor provision was enacted to encourage the development of new drugs and medical devices by protecting certain activities related to the preparation and submission of information to the FDA. 21 U.S.C. § 355(i). The provision is limited to activities that are reasonably related to the preparation and submission of information to the FDA, and does not extend to activities that are unrelated to this purpose. Merck, 545 U.S. at 208, 125 S.Ct. 2372. The majority's interpretation of the safe harbor would undermine this purpose by expanding the provision beyond its intended scope. In conclusion, the majority's opinion misreads the safe harbor provision and ignores the clear language of the statute. I respectfully dissent."
79,"the rest. In such instances, only items seized under the invalid portions of the warrant must be suppressed.” United States v. Krasaway, 881 F.2d 550, 553 (8th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). See also United States v. Timley, 443 F.3d 615, 622 (8th Cir.2006) (“[W]here the warrant is invalid only in part, the warrant is ‘severa-ble,’ and items seized pursuant to valid portions of the warrant need not be suppressed”). Here, no computer hard drives, disks or stored data were seized. See Gov’t Ex. 2, Attachment A, Bates Stamp Nos. 000024-27. As such, even if this portion of the warrant were severed, the evidence seized from the residence would clearly fall within valid portions of warrant, and suppression of the evidence seized in this case is not required. See Krasaway, 881 F.2d at 553 (<HOLDING>). Nyberg’s particularity argument is rejected.",holding that defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because the actual items seized fell within the valid portions of the warrant,"11 B. The Warrant Was Not Overly Broad As to Count One, the Indictment alleges that Nyberg knowingly and willfully transmitted a threat in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(e). Count Two charges Nyberg with transmitting a threat to a person who was engaged in a commercial activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(e). In order to establish these offenses, the government must prove that Nyberg transmitted a threat that was connected to interstate commerce or a commercial activity. To demonstrate this connection, the government may introduce evidence that the threat was transmitted via the internet or another means of interstate communication, or that the threat was directed at a person or organization engaged in interstate commerce or a commercial activity. In this case, the warrant authorized the seizure of “computer hard drives, disks, or stored data” that relate to the offenses charged in the indictment. Gov’t Ex. 2, Attachment A, Bates Stamp Nos. 000024-27. As the government notes, this language is not overly broad, as it specifically refers to “computer hard drives, disks, or stored data” that relate to the charged offenses. The warrant does not authorize the seizure of any other types of evidence, such as documents or other physical objects. Moreover, the warrant is limited in time, expiring on March 12, 2009, which is the date of the scheduled hearing on the motion to suppress. This limitation ensures that the warrant is not overly broad and that the government may only seize evidence that is relevant to the charged offenses. Nyberg argues that the warrant is overly broad because it authorizes the seizure of all of his computer hard drives, disks, and stored data, regardless of whether they relate to the charged offenses. However, as the government notes, the warrant specifically refers to “computer hard drives, disks, or stored data” that relate to the charged offenses. This language is not overly broad, as it specifically limits the scope of the warrant to evidence that is relevant to the charged offenses. In addition, the warrant is limited in time, which further ensures that the government may only seize evidence that is relevant to the charged offenses. Based on the foregoing, the court finds that the warrant was not overly broad as to Count One or Count Two of the indictment. 12 C. The Warrant Was Not Obtained in Violation of Any Defendant’s Constitutional Rights Nyberg argues that the warrant was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by failing to provide him with adequate notice of the offenses charged in the indictment and the evidence that would be seized pursuant to the warrant. However, as the government notes, the warrant specifically identifies the offenses charged in the indictment and the evidence that will be seized pursuant to the warrant. This language provides adequate notice to Nyberg of the offenses charged and the evidence that will be seized. Moreover, the warrant is limited in time, which ensures that the government may only seize evidence that is relevant to the charged offenses. Based on the foregoing, the court finds that the warrant was"

U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2003). Rule 24 should be construed liberally, with all “doubts resolved in favor of the ee Utahns for Better Transp., 295 F.3d at 1115 (“The threat of economic injury from the outcome of litigation undoubtedly gives a petitioner the requisite interest.”). When a third party files suit to compel governmental agency action that would directly harm a regulated company, the company’s economic interests in the lawsuit satisfy Rule 24(a)(2)’s recognized-interest requirement. See, e.g., Kleissler v. U.S. Forest Serv., 157 F.3d 964, 972 (3d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>); Sierra Club v. Glickman, 82 F.3d 106, 109",holding that timber companies had an interest in a lawsuit aimed at changing their methods of timbercutting,"(D.C.Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). The recognized interest requirement is met when the party seeking intervention has a “direct and immediate” economic interest in the outcome of the litigation. See, e.g., In re Methyl Tertiary Amine (MTA) Antitrust Litig., 236 F.3d 1081, 1091 (9th Cir.2001). The interest of a regulated company in the outcome of a lawsuit against a governmental agency is direct and immediate where the agency’s action would directly harm the company’s business or property rights. See, e.g., United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 566, 577, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 255 (1973) (<HOLDING>). In sum, the recognized interest requirement of Rule 24(a)(2) is met when a third party seeks intervention to protect a direct and immediate economic interest in the outcome of the litigation. See, e.g., Kleissler, 157 F.3d at 972; Sierra Club, 82 F.3d at 109. The regulated company’s interest in the outcome of the lawsuit is direct and immediate because the agency’s action would directly harm the company’s business or property rights. 10 C.F.R. § 21.3(a) (“The Commission may grant an exemption from the requirements of [the Atomic Energy Act] to any person if the Commission determines that the exemption is authorized by law and is in the public interest.”). The company’s interest in the outcome of the lawsuit is direct and immediate because the agency’s action would directly harm the company’s business or property rights. The company’s recognized interest in the outcome of the lawsuit satisfies Rule 24(a)(2)’s recognized-interest requirement. See, e.g., In re Methyl Tertiary Amine (MTA) Antitrust Litig., 236 F.3d 1081, 1091 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, the company may seek intervention as a matter of right under Rule 24(a)(2). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2); see also South Dakota ex rel. Barnett v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 317 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2003). 10 C.F.R. § 21.3(a) (“The Commission may grant an exemption from the requirements of [the Atomic Energy Act] to any person if the Commission determines that the exemption is authorized by law and is in the public interest.”).

81,"the Court in this case but none has been received in any other ease on the effect of Pub.L. No. 105-111, although the Court was in the process of ordering such briefing in Donovan when the appellant there filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), thus divesting this Court of jurisdiction over that appeal, see Cerullo v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 195, 196 (1991); Donovan v. Gober, 11 Vet.App. 2 (1997) (per curiam order) (Steinberg and Kramer, JJ., concurring). The Court’s opinion in Dittrich holds that a CUE claim as to an unappealed and therefore final 1960 Veterans’ Administration (now Department of Veterans Affairs) (VA) regional office (RO) decision was not able to be raised under Smith (William) v. Brown, 35 F.3d 1516, 1527 (Fed.Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>), because that final VARO decision was",holding that cue review applies only to prior final decisions of agencies of original jurisdiction ros and not to prior decisions of the board,"not subject to judicial review under 38 U.S.C. § 7252 (1994). The Court held that a CUE claim is not cognizable under 38 U.S.C. § 7266(a) (1994) if the claim is based on a final VARO decision that is not subject to judicial review under 38 U.S.C. § 7252 (1994). The Court further held that the Board’s remand order was not a final decision subject to judicial review under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994) and therefore the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the CUE claim. The Court also held that the Board’s failure to address the appellant’s CUE claim in its remand order was not a basis for finding that the Board’s decision was not a final decision subject to judicial review under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994). The Court noted that the Board has the authority to consider CUE claims on remand and that the appellant was free to raise the CUE claim in a subsequent appeal to the Federal Circuit if the Board’s remand decision is not final. The Court further noted that the appellant’s CUE claim was not barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 7266(a)(2) (1994) because the appellant did not file the CUE claim with the Board until after the Board’s remand order.
The Court then considered the appellant’s argument that the Board’s remand order was a final decision subject to judicial review under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994) because it was a final decision in the sense that it resolved all issues in the case. The Court held that the Board’s remand order was not a final decision under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (1994) because it was not a final decision that terminated the litigation between the parties. The Court noted that the Board’s remand order left open the possibility of further proceedings before the Board and therefore did not terminate the litigation between the parties. The Court also noted that the Board’s remand order did not resolve all issues in the case because the appellant was free to raise additional claims in a subsequent appeal to the Federal Circuit.

Thus, the harm to be evaluated is the harm attributable to the loss of one of the statutorily limited-in-number peremptory challenges. See State v. Neuendorf, 509 N.W.2d 743, 746 (Iowa 1993). 1 25 Second, in Novotny, the court appears to have regarded the error at issue in a case such as this as the deprivation of a peremptory challenge. See Novotny, I 14 (referring to the ""erroneous ruling on a challenge for cause adversely impacting the defendaﬁt’s ability to shape the jury through peremptory challenges""), 122 (same), 128 (referring to the ""violation of our statutes and rules prescribing the use of peremptory challenges""), 1 27 (<HOLDING>). As discussed, such a deprivation is not a",holding that allowing a defendant fewer peremptory challenges than authorized or than available to and exercised by the prosecution does not in and of itself amount to structural error,"harmless error, see supra note 1, and therefore the error in this case is not harmless. 26 Third, in Ross, the court explicitly held that the deprivation of a peremptory challenge is not harmless error. See Ross, 487 U.S. at 93, 108 S.Ct. 2273 (holding that the deprivation of a peremptory challenge is not harmless error where the defendant has been excused from trial by a peremptory challenge). 27 Fourth, in State v. Neuendorf, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the deprivation of a peremptory challenge is not harmless error. See Neuendorf, 509 N.W.2d at 746. 28 27 Finally, in United States v. Frady, the Eleventh Circuit held that the deprivation of a peremptory challenge is not harmless error. See Frady, 456 U.S. at 170, 102 S.Ct. 1584 (holding that the deprivation of a peremptory challenge is not harmless error where the defendant has been excused from trial by a peremptory challenge). 28"
83,"that it accumulated dirt over a long period of time than it can support the opposite inference that the macaroni had just been dropped on the floor and was quickly contaminated by customers and carts traversing the aisle. In Furr’s Supermarkets, Inc. v. Arellano, 492 S.W.2d 727 (Tex.Civ.App.—El Paso 1973, writ ref'd n.r.e.), another spilled-macaroni ease, the court held that testimony that the dried macaroni noodles that caused the plaintiffs fall were “soiled, scattered and appeared as though other persons had passed through the area and had been run over presumably by another cart or carts” was no evidence of the length of time the macaroni noodles had been there. Id. at 728; see also H.E. Butt Grocery Co. v. Rodriguez, 441 S.W.2d 215, 217 (Tex.Civ.App.—Corpus Christi 1969, no writ) (<HOLDING>); H.E. Butt Grocery Store v. Hamilton, 632",holding that testimony that the grape on which plaintiff slipped was squashed and muddy that the floor was dirty and that pieces of paper were strewn around nearby was no evidence that the grape had been on the floor long enough to charge the store with notice,"S.W.2d 772, 774 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 1982, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (<HOLDING>).
In summary, the length of time that a spilled substance remains on the floor before it is cleaned up can be an important factor in determining whether a plaintiff has established that the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the hazardous condition. However, the length of time the substance remains on the floor is not always the most relevant factor, as other circumstances, such as the frequency of foot traffic in the area, the type of substance spilled, and the actions of the defendant or its agents, may also be considered in evaluating the defendant's notice."
84,"of facts, as discussed in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, 499 U.S. 340, 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991). Plaintiffs, however do not apply this analysis to the contents of the works in question nor do they in any way demonstrate that it is original, copyrightable work created by Garcia Goy-co himself, as opposed to all of the other contributors. Not all works can be copyrighted. Merely because the works were deposited in the Copyright Office and have certificates of registration, does not mean that they were copyrightable subject matter. Expression in the public domain may not be monopolized by mere copyright registration. See e.g., Tufenkian Import/Export Ventures, Inc. v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., 237 F.Supp.2d 376, 384 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (“Tufenkian ”) (<HOLDING>); Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d805 (9th",holding as a matter of law that adaptations of subject matter or expressions in the public domain cannot support a finding of copyright infringement,"Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>).
In Tufenkian, the court held that a work of art, which was created by the plaintiff, was not copyrightable because it was not original enough. The court stated that “[t]o be eligible for copyright protection, a work must be original, meaning that it must be the author's own expression of an idea, rather than a copy of something else. The idea itself cannot be copyrighted, but the expression of the idea can be.” Tufenkian, 237 F.Supp.2d at 384 (citing Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)).
Similarly, in Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d 805 (9th Cir.2003), the court held that a work of art was not copyrightable because it was not original enough. The court stated that “[a] work of art that is not original is not eligible for copyright protection.” Satava, 323 F.3d at 813 (citing Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 348, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991)).
In conclusion, plaintiffs have not presented any evidence to demonstrate that the works in question are original, copyrightable works created by Garcia Goyco himself. The works may be in the public domain, or may not be eligible for copyright protection. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss the second cause of action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."
85,"In 2001, President Bush announced that he planned to lift a temporary ban on Mexican trucking companies in the United States once new regulations were prepared by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to regulate safety inspections and applications to transport materials. Congress specified certain standards that those regulations would have to meet before it would appropriate money to register the new carriers. When the FMCSA formulated its regulations, it performed an Environmental Assessment (EA) to examine along their effects on the environment. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), federal agencies must perform an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of policies that are likely to have significant environmental effects. If an agency feels that its policies will not have significant effects, however, it may perform a more limited Environmental Assessment (EA) - which is what FMCSA chose to do. Public Citizen, a watchdog group that monitors indium government actions, challenged this decision in federal court. It argued that, because FMCSA knew that a large number of Mexican trucks would be admitted into the United States once it issued its regulations, it should have considered the environmental impact of the increased number of trucks cope with in addition to the more limited impact of the safety inspections. The impact of the trucks would have been significant enough representation to warrant an EIS, so Public Citizen argued that FMCSA had violated NEPA by not conducting the more stringent study. The district court side with the FMCSA, holding that, while the passage of the regulations was necessary before the crataegus laevigata trucks could be admitted, the FMCSA nevertheless did not have control of those trucks and therefore did not have to account for them in its Environmental Assessment; a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed.","The winner of this case is Department of Transportation, et al..","The full Ninth Circuit then reheard the case and affirmed the panel's decision. The court held that FMCSA had to consider the environmental impact of the increased number of Mexican trucks entering the United States, even though the agency did not have direct control over those trucks, because the agency's regulations would have a direct impact on the number of trucks that would be admitted to the country. The court noted that the agency had acknowledged that the regulations would have a significant impact on the environment and that it had therefore prepared an Environmental Assessment. The court found that this was insufficient, however, because the assessment did not consider the impact of the increased number of trucks on the environment. The court held that FMCSA had violated NEPA by failing to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that would have taken into account this significant environmental effect. The court remanded the case to the district court with instructions to order FMCSA to prepare an EIS."

Dec. 597, 604 (<HOLDING>), the court observed that the allegations",recognizing implied private action under the collection agency act,"of the complaint did not show that the plaintiff was a “direct purchaser” of the medical services at issue, and thus the plaintiff was not within the “zone of interest” protected by the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. This factor is not a basis for finding a private right of action under section 2 — 123(h), as the Act does not expressly provide for a private right of action for violations of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.

To fall within the ex post facto prohibition, a criminal law must contain two critical elements: first, the law must be retrospective; and second, it must disadvantage the offender affected by it. Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423, 430, 107 S.Ct. 2446, 96 L.Ed.2d 351 (1987). A law is retrospective if it changes “the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.” Id. The completed “acts” in a probation revocation case are those that make up the underlying offense. See Johnson v. United States, 529 U.S. 694, 700, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000); see also Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973) (<HOLDING>). The prohibition against ex post facto laws",holding probation revocation is not a stage of a criminal prosecution,"“applies to any law that punishes as a crime an act that was not punishable in the jurisdiction when committed.” Calder v. United States, 149 U.S. 1, 11, 13 S.Ct. 782, 37 L.Ed. 376 (1893). Appellant’s probation revocation was based on acts committed before the effective date of the law at issue, and therefore, the law does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in revoking appellant’s probation. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171"

The special circumstance found by the jury of murder during the commission of reestablish rape made Thompson eligible for the death penalty. In 1995, a federal District Court invalidated Thompson's death sentence by granted relief on his rape conviction and the rape special circumstance. In reversing, the motor hotel Court of Appeals reinstated Thompson's death sentence, noting that the State presented strong evidence of rape at trial. The Court of Appeals then issued a mandate denying all habeas relief. Two days before Thompson's execution, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate and granted Thompson relief. The appellate court found last that Thompson set up was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial.",The winner of this case is Calderone.,"The court found that Thompson's attorney failed to investigate and present evidence of Thompson's mental disease or defect, which could have challenged the rape conviction. The court further found that the attorney's failure to raise this issue at trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The court then ordered the state to grant Thompson a new trial or to vacate his death sentence. The state supreme court denied review of the court of appeals decision. In conclusion, the case of Thomas M. Thompson v. California highlights the importance of effective assistance of counsel in death penalty cases. The case also underscores the need for states to ensure that defendants receive fair and just trials, free from errors that could result in wrongful convictions."

In particular, Fuchs stated that her supervisor suggested that Fuchs “realize [she is] broken and go on disability.” Fuchs claimed that her supervisor has questioned her repeatedly about the length of time she requires to use the restroom, and has limited the times during which Fuchs may use the restroom during the workday. Fuchs testified about other actions her supervisor has taken against her, including questioning the volume of work Fuchs completes each day, punishing Fuchs for tardiness, denying Fuchs’s request for leave to see her doctor, and requiring a note from Fuchs’s doctor before allowing her to wear tennis shoes to work. Fuchs testified during her deposition that she believed her supervisor’s remarks and conduct were “in ) (<HOLDING>). Here, viewing the facts in the light most",holding that it is peculiarly the jurys function to pass upon what would meet the requirements or satisfy the mind of the theoretical reason able ordinary person which the law gives to the jury as a standard by which to measure human conduct,"favorable to Fuchs, it is clear that her supervisor’s comments and conduct were severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. Fuchs’s supervisor repeatedly questioned Fuchs about the length of time she spends in the restroom, and limited the times during which Fuchs may use the restroom during the workday. Fuchs’s supervisor also made derogatory comments about Fuchs’s medical condition, and questioned the volume of work Fuchs completes each day. These actions are sufficient to create a hostile work environment, and demonstrate that Fuchs’s supervisor’s conduct was not merely an isolated incident, but rather a persistent pattern of conduct that created a hostile work environment for Fuchs. 10 Case 2:17-cv-00181-JAD-EPG Document 32 Filed 05/22/18 Page 11 of 13 Page ID#:1543 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 United States District Court Northern District of Indiana South Bend Division Fuchs v. Indiana Michigan Power Company, et al. The court finds that Fuchs has established a hostile work environment claim under the ADA, as her supervisor’s conduct was severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment. 4. Retaliation Claim (Count II) Fuchs also alleges that she was subjected to retaliation by her supervisor after she filed a complaint with the Company’s HR department regarding the hostile work environment. Fuchs claims that her supervisor’s conduct was retaliatory because it was motivated by the Company’s desire to punish Fuchs for filing the complaint. Specifically, Fuchs alleges that her supervisor questioned the volume of work Fuchs completes each day, and limited the times during which Fuchs may use the restroom during the workday. Fuchs testified during her deposition that she believed her supervisor’s remarks and conduct were “in direct retaliation for [her] filing the complaint with HR.” Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Fuchs, it is clear that her supervisor’s conduct was motivated by the Company’s desire to punish Fuchs for filing the complaint. Fuchs’s supervisor questioned the volume of work Fuchs completes each day, and limited the times during which Fuchs may use the restroom during the workday. These actions are sufficient to establish a retaliation claim under the ADA. 11 Case 2:17-cv-00181-JAD-EPG Document 32 Filed 05/22/18 Page 12 of 13 Page ID#:1544 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 United States District Court Northern District of Indiana South Bend Division Fuchs v.

Respondent argues that the reimbursement was not “necessary” within the meaning of section 20.2053-3(a), Estate Tax Regs., because the Erie stock belonged to Black LP, not Mrs. Black’s estate, and that Black LP sold the stock. To the extent the secondary offering of Erie stock generated funds needed and used to discharge debts of Mrs. Black’s estate, Black LP’s obligation to reimburse Erie for costs associated with that offering was related to and occasioned by Mrs. Black’s death, and, for that reason, the reimbursement might be deductible by her estate under section 2053. Accord sec. 20.2053-8(d), Example (2), Estate Tax Regs.; see Burrow Trust v. Commissioner, 39 T.C. 1080, 1089 (1963) (<HOLDING>), affd. 333 F.2d 66 (10th Cir. 1964). Moreover,",holding that where a revocable inter vivos trust paid its own trustees fees the settlors estate could nonetheless deduct those fees under section 2053 because the trustees services were primarily occasioned by the death of the decedent,"the reimbursement was made by Erie to Black LP, not to Mrs. Black’s estate, and, therefore, it is not subject to the limitations of section 2053(a)(3). Respondent argues that the reimbursement was not a “reasonable and necessary” cost of administration because the amount of the reimbursement was not substantiated by sufficient evidence and, in any event, the cost of the offering was not incurred in the administration of the estate. Respondent contends that the record does not show that the reimbursement was made to cover any specific expenses of the estate or that it was used for any purpose related to the administration of the estate. Petitioners argue that the reimbursement was made to cover the costs of the offering, which was necessary to raise funds to pay debts of Mrs. Black’s estate, and that the amount of the reimbursement was a reasonable and necessary cost of administration. The record shows that the Erie stock was owned by Black LP, not by Mrs. Black’s estate, and that Black LP sold the stock to raise funds to pay debts of Mrs. Black’s estate. The reimbursement was made by Erie to Black LP, not to Mrs. Black’s estate, and, therefore, it is not subject to the limitations of section 2053(a)(3).
Whether the reimbursement was made to cover the costs of the offering, which was necessary to raise funds to pay debts of Mrs. Black’s estate, or to cover other expenses of the estate, the reimbursement was a “reasonable and necessary” cost of administration within the meaning of section 20.2053-3(a), Estate Tax Regs. The record does not show that the reimbursement was made to cover any specific expenses of the estate or that it was used for any purpose related to the administration of the estate. The reimbursement was made by Erie to Black LP, not to Mrs. Black’s estate, and, therefore, it is not subject to the limitations of section 2053(a)(3). Accordingly, the reimbursement is deductible by Mrs. Black’s estate under section 2053."

93,"the more clear in light of the materials on which we relied in our agency analysis in Laurel Baye. All the sources we cited dealt with an agent who had authority to speak finally on the principal’s behalf with permanent legal effect. See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Agency § 3.07(4) (2006) (explaining that an agent’s actual authority to affect its principal’s legal relations expires when the principal’s power to act is suspended); 2 William Meade Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 504 (2008) (same, with respect to the resignation or termination of the delegating authority); Id. § 421 (“If there are fewer than the minimum number of directors required by statute, [the remaining directors] cannot act as a board.”); Emerson v. Fisher, 246 F. 642, 648 (1st Cir.1918) (<HOLDING>). In every case the cited rule prohibits an",holding that a corporate treasurers delegee lacks authority to disburse corporate funds after the treasurer himself resigns,"agent from acting on behalf of the principal in a way that would be legally binding after the principal’s authority has been terminated. In other words, the agent’s authority to act is limited to the duration of the principal’s power to act, and any act taken after that period is ultra vires and invalid.
In contrast, the situation here involves an agent who is not authorized to act on behalf of the principal with permanent legal effect. The agent’s authority is limited to a specific transaction or set of transactions, and does not confer any permanent authority to bind the principal. The principal has not granted the agent the power to act on its behalf with permanent legal effect, and the agent does not have the authority to bind the principal after the transaction is complete. In this situation, the agent’s act is not ultra vires and is valid, even if it is taken after the principal’s authority has been terminated.
Therefore, the rule that an agent’s authority is limited to the duration of the principal’s power to act does not apply in this situation, and the agent’s act is valid."
94,"The father, relying on Opinion of the Clerk No. 21, 375 So.2d 1066 (Ala.1979), argues that the mother failed to properly institute her contempt action because she did not file her contempt action separately or pay a separate filing fee. Although it appears that the opinion the father relies upon supports his contention, as does Opinion of the Clerk No. 25, 381 So.2d 58, 59 (Ala.1980) (“The basic differences between contempt proceedings and proceedings to modify a final decree preclude the inclusion of a petition for rule nisi and a petition to modify in the same pleading.”), we note that both opinions predate the adoption of Rule 70A, Ala. R. Civ. P., which now governs contempt proceedings arising out of civil actions. See Ex parte Boykin, 656 So.2d 821, 827 n. 5 (Ala.Civ.App.1994) (<HOLDING>). Rule 70A expressly provides that contempt",recognizing that as of july 11 1994 contempt proceedings arising from civil actions are no longer governed by rule 333 ala rcrim p and instead are governed by rule 70a,"proceedings may be brought as a separate civil action or as part of a pending civil action. Ala. R. Civ. P. 70A(a). Accordingly, in this case, the mother was not required to file a separate contempt action or pay a separate filing fee.

The father also argues that the mother's contempt action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as the issue of the father's alleged contempt was previously litigated in the divorce action. The mother responds that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply because the issue of the father's contempt was not actually litigated in the divorce action, but rather was merely raised in a motion to modify the divorce decree. We agree with the mother.

In Ex parte Crawford, 436 So.2d 1069 (Ala.Civ.App.1983), this court held that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar a subsequent contempt action where the issue of contempt was not actually litigated in the prior action. Id. at 1071. In the present case, the father's alleged contempt was not actually litigated in the divorce action, but rather was raised in a motion to modify the divorce decree. Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the mother's contempt action.

We next consider the mother's argument that the father's alleged contempt is barred by the statute of limitations. The mother argues that the father's alleged contempt occurred in 1994, more than two years before the mother filed her contempt action in 1996. The mother contends that the father's alleged contempt is therefore barred by the two-year statute of limitations for contempt actions set forth in Rule 70A(c), Ala. R. Civ. P. The father responds that the mother's contempt action is barred by the doctrine of laches.

We agree with the mother that the father's alleged contempt is barred by the statute of limitations. Rule 70A(c) provides that a contempt action must be brought within two years after the alleged contemptuous conduct occurred. Here, the mother alleges that the father's alleged contempt occurred in 1994, more than two years before she filed her contempt action in 1996. Accordingly, the mother's contempt action is not barred by the statute of limitations.

We also find that the mother's contempt action is not barred by the doctrine of laches. The doctrine of laches is a defense to a contempt action that is based on conduct that occurred more than two years before the filing of the contempt action. Rule 70A(c); Ex parte Hodges, 626 So.2d 1238, 1240 (Ala.Civ.App.1993). However, the doctrine of laches will not bar a contempt action where the party seeking the contempt action can show that the alleged contemptuous conduct was a continuous or ongoing violation of the court's order, and that the party seeking the contempt action has been diligent in pursuing the contempt action"

Tax-Gen. Code Ann. §§ 13-510 through 13-529.” Bancroft Info. Grp., Inc., supra, 91 Md.App. at 115, 603 A.2d 1289; see also Kuypers v. Comptroller of the Treasury, 173 F.Supp.2d 393, 396 (D.Md.2001) (<HOLDING>). In the realm of general tax law,",recognizing that pursuant to  13505 the general assembly has by statute expressed its intention that no suit may be brought to interfere with the statutory process for the assessment or collection of a state tax,"therefore, we have consistently held that taxpayers must pursue their remedies through the procedures established by the Tax Court, rather than seeking a declaratory judgment action. 5
5. For example, in Bancroft Information Group, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, 91 Md.App. 115, 603 A.2d 1289 (1992), the taxpayer sought a declaratory judgment action to challenge the Comptroller’s assessment of a tax deficiency. The Court of Special Appeals held that the taxpayer was required to pursue the remedy provided by Tax-Gen. § 13-510 et seq. rather than seeking a declaratory judgment action. Id. at 117-18, 603 A.2d 1289. Similarly, in Kuypers v. Comptroller of the Treasury, 173 F.Supp.2d 393 (D.Md.2001), the district court held that the taxpayer was required to pursue the remedy provided by Tax-Gen. § 13-510 et seq. rather than seeking a declaratory judgment action. Id. at 396. 6
6. In contrast, when a taxpayer challenges the assessment of a tax deficiency based on a constitutional or other non-tax law claim, the taxpayer may pursue a declaratory judgment action in court. See generally Bancroft Information Group, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, supra; Kuypers v. Comptroller of the Treasury, supra. In such cases, the taxpayer may seek a declaratory judgment that the assessment of the tax deficiency is unconstitutional or otherwise violates non-tax law principles. Id. 7
7. In conclusion, the Maryland Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction over tax disputes, and taxpayers must pursue their remedies through the procedures established by the Tax Court. Taxpayers may not seek a declaratory judgment action to challenge the assessment of a tax deficiency, but rather must follow the procedures established by Tax-Gen. § 13-510 et seq. to seek review of the assessment. Bancroft Information Group, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, supra; Kuypers v. Comptroller of the Treasury, supra. However, when a taxpayer challenges the assessment of a tax deficiency based on a constitutional or other non-tax law claim, the taxpayer may pursue a declaratory judgment action in court. Id. 8
8. The Maryland Tax Court’s exclusive jurisdiction over tax disputes and the requirement that taxpayers pursue their remedies through the procedures established by the Tax Court are consistent with the principles of administrative law and the policies underlying the tax system. The Tax Court is a specialized tribunal with expertise in tax law and the procedures for resolving tax disputes. By requiring taxpayers to pursue their remedies through the Tax Court, the Maryland Legislature has ensured that tax disputes"
97,"Express, Inc., 334 Pa.Super. 295, 483 A.2d 456 (1984). Although such statements may ultimately prove to be false or maliciously motivated, the same may be said of statements made by a party who consults with his or her attorney preliminary to instituting a civil action, or of statements made by counsel in preliminary conferences or negotiations on their client’s behalf. Nevertheless, such statements are deemed to be absolutely privileged because the policy concerns stated above outweigh the right of the defamation plaintiff to seek redress for harm caused by the statements. Pawlowski v. Smorto, 403 Pa.Super. 71, 588 A.2d 36, 41-42 (1991) (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). See also Marino v. Fava, 915 A.2d 121, 124 (Pa.Super.2006), appeal denied, 592 Pa. 782, 926 A.2d 975 (2007) (<HOLDING>). Herein, Appellant admits Appellee’s allegedly",holding that statements an uncle made in an application to have his nephew involuntarily committed along with those he later made at the commitment hearing were absolutely privileged and could not form the basis for a defamation action,"defamatory statements were made in the course of a preliminary conference with counsel, and thus are absolutely privileged under Pennsylvania law. See id. at 124 (<HOLDING>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, based on the foregoing analysis, this Court holds that the trial court properly granted Appellee’s motion to dismiss Appellant’s defamation claim. Appellant’s allegedly defamatory statements were made in the course of a preliminary conference with counsel, and thus are absolutely privileged under Pennsylvania law. Accordingly, Appellant’s defamation claim must be dismissed.</p>

<p>Judgment Entered in Favor of Appellee.</p>

<p>End of Opinion</p>

This is a sample opinion, and you should consult with an attorney to ensure that it is accurate and applicable to your specific case. The opinion provides a detailed explanation of the legal principles at play in the case, including the concept of absolute privilege, and how it applies to the defamation claim in this particular case. The opinion also provides a clear holding that the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss the defamation claim, and provides the reasons for that holding."
98,"(although they certainly may be persuasive).” Mathai v. Warren, 512 F.3d 1241, 1248 (10th Cir.2008). “For purposes of most bankruptcy proceedings, property interests are created and defined by state law. Once that state law determination is made, however, we must still look to federal bankruptcy law to resolve the extent to which that interest is property of the estate” under § 541. Parks v. FIA Card Servs., N.A., 550 F.3d 1251, 1255 (10th Cir.2008) (citations and quotations omitted); 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). We first consider whether and to what extent Debtors have an interest in the SARs under Kansas law. Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55, 99 S.Ct. 914, 59 L.Ed.2d 136 (1979); see, e.g., Williamson v. Hall, No. KS-08-088, 2009 WL 4456542, at *8 (10th Cir. BAP Dec. 4, 2009) (<HOLDING>). We then consider whether that interest",holding that pay on death accounts were not part of the bankruptcy estate under  541 because under kansas law debtor had no property interest in the accounts until the death of the owner,"is property of the estate under § 541. 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1).
The Bankruptcy Court held that the SARs were not property of the estate under § 541(a)(1) because they were not “property of the debtor” as of the petition date under Kansas law. Debtors argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred in this ruling. We agree.
Under Kansas law, a security interest in securities is created by a “security agreement.” K.S.A. 84-9-202. A security agreement is a contract between the secured party and the debtor that “grants a security interest in personal property.” K.S.A. 84-9-201(a). The agreement must describe the collateral and the security interest granted, and must be signed by the debtor. K.S.A. 84-9-202(a).
Here, the SARs were issued to the Debtors pursuant to a security agreement between the Debtors and the Issuer. The security agreement, which was executed on February 10, 2006, grants a security interest in the SARs in favor of the Issuer. The agreement specifically describes the SARs as “securities” and the security interest granted as a “security interest in the securities.” The agreement was signed by the Debtors, and it is undisputed that the Debtors were the holders of the SARs as of the petition date.
Under Kansas law, the security agreement creates a security interest in the SARs, which are personal property, as of the date of execution. See K.S.A. 84-9-202. As of the petition date, the Debtors held the SARs and had an interest in the property, which is sufficient to make the SARs “property of the estate” under § 541(a)(1).
The Bankruptcy Court's ruling to the contrary was error. The SARs are property of the estate under § 541(a)(1) because they were “property of the debtor” as of the petition date under Kansas law."
99,"Bradley Nigh bought a car from Koons Buick Pontiac GMC. Nigh later sued action machine the dealership for intentionally charging him for a car feature for which he did not agree to pay. Nigh sued under the federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA). A federal district court awarded Nigh about $24,000. Koons Buick appealed and argued the district franchise court ignored TILA's cap on damages to $1,000. A Fourth Circuit held that a 1995 amendment to the act removed the nether $1,000 cap on recoveries involving loans secured by buy personal property.","The winner of this case is Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc..","The court affirmed the district court's judgment in favor of Nigh and awarded him $24,000 in damages.

This case is significant because it established that the Truth in Lending Act's $1,000 cap on damages does not apply to all claims brought under the act, but rather only to claims involving loans secured by real property. This decision provides consumers with greater protections and the ability to recover larger damages awards for violations of the Truth in Lending Act.

The case is also significant because it highlights the importance of understanding the specific provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and how they apply to different types of transactions. Consumers who are dealing with car dealerships or other financial institutions should be aware of their rights and protections under the act, and should not hesitate to seek legal action if they believe they have been wronged.

In conclusion, the case of Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC is a significant decision that provides consumers with greater protections and the ability to recover larger damages awards for violations of the Truth in Lending Act. It highlights the importance of understanding the specific provisions of the act and how they apply to different types of transactions, and serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting consumers' rights in the financial marketplace."
